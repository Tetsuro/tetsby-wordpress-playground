be walking you through how to prevent users from going to the checkout page unless they have agreed to the Terms and Conditions using jQuery. We&#8217;ll be doing this by adding a checkbox to the cart page, which if checked, will allow the user to go the the checkout page. If it&#8217;s not checked, an alert box will be shown, and the user will be prevented from going to the checkout page.</p>
<p>You can see an example of this <a href="http://pop-omocha.myshopify.com/cart">here</a>. You&#8217;ll need to add a product to the cart first, though.</p>
<p><a href="http://pop-omocha.myshopify.com/cart"><img src="https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/terms-and-conditions-tutorial.jpg" alt="" title="terms and conditions" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; max-width:100%; height: auto;" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2314" /></a></p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<h2 class="steps">1. Adding the checkbox in cart.liquid</h2>
<p>In Template Editor, open cart.liquid. Enter the following code &#8211; this will insert a checkbox and a label to your cart page. Please make sure that the ids of the checkbox and the label are the same (I named mine &#8220;agree&#8221;). </p>
<pre>
<code>
<input type="checkbox" id="agree"/>
<label for="agree">I agree with the Terms and Conditions</label>
</code>
</pre>
<p>The location of where the above code goes will depend on how you want to style your cart page, but it can really go anywhere within the cart.liquid template. In my case, I&#8217;ve placed the checkbox and its label directly above the checkout button. Here is what my cart page looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/t_and_c_labels.jpg"><img src="https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/t_and_c_labels.jpg" alt="" title="t_and_c_labels" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; max-width:100%; height: auto;" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2322" srcset="https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/t_and_c_labels.jpg 982w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/t_and_c_labels-300x176.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/t_and_c_labels-768x450.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 982px) 100vw, 982px" /></a></p>
<h2 class="steps">2. Wrap your checkout buttons with a div with a unique ID</h2>
<p>The next thing you want to do is wrap the buttons for checking out (this includes the regular checkout buttons as well as any other buttons added by Paypal or Google Checkout) with a special div so that we can target all checkout buttons in our Javascript code. This step is very theme-dependent, so if you&#8217;re unsure about anything please make a post on the <a href="http://forums.shopify.com/categories/2">forums</a>.</p>
<p>As an example, your theme&#8217;s cart template might look like this:</p>
<pre>
<code>
<input type="submit" name="update" value="Update Cart" id="update-cart" class="btn update" />
<input id="checkout" class="btn checkout" type="submit" name="checkout"value="Check Out" />
{% if additional_checkout_buttons %}
<div class="additional-checkout-buttons">
	<p style="margin:20px 0;">- or -</p>
	{{ content_for_additional_checkout_buttons }}
</div>
{% endif %}
</code>
</pre>
<p>What you want to do now is wrap is in a new div, and give it a class called &#8220;submit-cart&#8221; (shown in red below). This class name is used for the jQuery script that we&#8217;re going to add in the next step. </p>
<pre>
<code>
<span style="color:red;"><div class="submit-cart"></span>
<input type="submit" name="update" value="Update Cart" id="update-cart" class="btn update" />
<input id="checkout" class="btn checkout" type="submit" name="checkout"value="Check Out" />
{% if additional_checkout_buttons %}
<div class="additional-checkout-buttons">
	<p style="margin:20px 0;">- or -</p>
	{{ content_for_additional_checkout_buttons }}
</div>
{% endif %}
<span style="color:red;"></div></span>
</code>
</pre>
<h2 class="steps">3. Insert the jQuery code</h2>
<p>The last step is to add the jQuery code that checks to see if the checkbox has been checked or not. In your Template Editor, create a new snippet, and name it &#8220;terms-and-conditions&#8221;.
</p>
<p> Next, copy the code from this <a href="https://gist.github.com/Tetsuro/2950334/raw/4c0baeb679f3e8005cc6810f2a67196dad2be9a2/jquery.t-and-c.js.liquid">gist</a>, paste it inside the &#8220;terms-and-conditions&#8221; snippet, and hit save.
</p>
<p>Finally, in “theme.liquid”, place the code below right before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.</p>
<pre>
<code>
{% include 'terms-and-conditions' %}
</code>
</pre>
<p>Once this code is in place, your customers will not be able to proceed to the checkout without having checked the &#8220;I agree&#8221; checkbox. If they don&#8217;t have it checked, they will be shown a Javascript alert box instead of being taken to the checkout page. This code will work even if you have additional buttons for checking out (Paypal, Google Checkout).</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/denied.jpg"><img src="https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/denied.jpg"  title="Denied!!!!" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; max-width:100%; height: auto;"  /></a></p>
<div class="sub">DENIED!!!</div>
</p>
<h2 class="steps">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This may be a bit bothersome from a buyer&#8217;s point-of-view, but from my understanding some places have laws that make it imperative to have an &#8220;I agree&#8221; checkbox when buying products online. </p>
<p>Hope that helped, &#8217;til next time!</p>

</div></div><div><strong>Frank</strong><p>March 29th, 2015</p><div><p>The click event wasn&#8217;t registered for me, so I also got the same problem as many have reported that not checking the box allowed you to proceed.  After some debugging, I think that the jQuery(document).ready handler is executed when the Add to Cart page is up, but the Checkout button somehow wasn&#8217;t isn&#8217;t loaded that that moment, so the event handler is probably never attached.</p>
<p>I am using the default shopify jquery in my themes.liquid:<br />
{{ &#8216;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js&#8217; | script_tag }}</p>
<p>I follow the example from:<br />
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5540561/jquery-click-event-not-firing" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5540561/jquery-click-event-not-firing</a></p>
<p>and change this example to use instead of:<br />
jQuery(&#8220;.submit-cart input[type=&#8217;submit&#8217;],.submit-cart input[type=&#8217;image&#8217;]&#8221;).click(function(){</p>
<p>to:<br />
jQuery(document).on(&#8216;click&#8217;, &#8220;.submit-cart input[type=&#8217;submit&#8217;],.submit-cart input[type=&#8217;image&#8217;]&#8221;, function(){ // this works</p>
<p>This attach the handler to the whole document, not the most efficient, but that worked for me as a workaround.</p>

I have included the code in my website. It seems to work very well, but I have two little quetions here:<br />
1. How can I manage to have the checkbox aligned to the right, just on top of the actual button (as on your example)? It always aligns to the left and there it seems a bit lost.<br />
2. I did not understand how to create the link to my &#8220;Terms &amp; Conditions&#8221; page.<br />
I would be greatful for help here.<br />
Otherwise, great great tutorial! Thanks so much.<br />

</div></div><div><strong>Phil Jordan</strong><p>July 16th, 2013</p><div><p>Further to the above &#8230; I have a work around, which is basically putting the label info that I want to show (including a link) right after a dummy label which doesn’t show up as far as I have tried on Safari (Mac and iPad) or Firefox, but may do on another browser one day.</p>
<p>I have substituted the html brackets for normal ones () in the hope it shows the code here:</p>
<p>(input type=&#8221;checkbox&#8221; name=“agree&#8221; id=&#8221;agree” /)<br />
(label for=“agree”) *Yes,(/label) I agree with the (a href=pages/terms-and-conditions target=“_blank”)Terms and Conditions(/a)</p>
<p>Which on my site just shows the checkbox, followed by:<br />
I agree with the <a href="pages/terms-and-conditions" rel="nofollow">Terms and Conditions</a></p>
<p>Thanks again Tetchi, perhaps this will be useful for anyone else who has the same ‘no label showing’ issue I have had.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Phil Jordan</strong><p>July 15th, 2013</p><div><p>Hi Tetchi</p>
<p>This is exactly what I need for an ‘about-to-go-live’ Shopify store.  However, the checkbox appears but with no label text showing (I haven’t altered yours, just copied pasted).</p>
<p>As a total newbie, perhaps I don’t know something obvious to most?  The checkbox appears in the place I want it, but is a box with no text next to it!!</p>
<p>I haven’t put the final bit of code in the theme.liquid page yet as I guess I should get this bit right first!</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.  It’s great to find this sort of thing so easily, excellent resource.<br />
Phil</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Lisa</strong><p>July 11th, 2013</p><div><p>Hi Fran,<br />
It won&#8217;t let me type out the code.  It keeps just highlighting terms and conditions.  You can email me at <a href="mailto:info@housekeepingstore.co.uk">info@housekeepingstore.co.uk</a> and I&#8217;ll mail you back.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Lisa</strong><p>July 11th, 2013</p><div><p>Sorry Fran,<br />
Tried to answer you late last night and pasted in what I had put on mine, didn&#8217;t work, so here is the code I put in mine and it worked after that.  I did type some of it manually and didn&#8217;t paste it in.</p>
<p>I agree with the<a href="/pages/terms-conditions" rel="nofollow">Terms and Conditions</a></p>
<p>You have to put in your handle though for your terms and conditions page, mines is  terms-conditions you can see that I&#8217;ve put it after pages/.  Hope this works, I&#8217;m no expert and I have typed it out so hopefully I&#8217;ve not missed anything small.</p>
<p>Good luck<br />
Lisa X</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Fran</strong><p>July 11th, 2013</p><div><p>Hi Fran,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. What I actually mean is, how did you make the &#8220;terms and conditions&#8221; bit hyperlink back to your t&amp;c page?</p>

</div></div><div><strong>tetchi</strong><p>June 20th, 2013</p><div><p>Hey Lisa, the code I pasted should do that already &#8211; it simply contains a link to /pages/terms-and-conditions, where &#8216;terms-and-conditions&#8217; is the handle of your page.</p>

<p>What I would really like is in this screenshot I would like the terms and conditions to be highlighted and just be able to click on that to take you to my terms and conditions page.  Any chance????</p>
<p><a href="http://snag.gy/O415P.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://snag.gy/O415P.jpg</a></p>
<p>Thanks Lisa</p>
<p>Oh still not working when I put my terms and conditions handle in.  Also the original code you sent me isn&#8217;t the same as in the blog.  When I wanted to put it back to how it was I copied and pasted the code from the last mail you sent me but it didn&#8217;t work so I had to go and copy it from the original blog.  Hope this makes sense.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>tetchi</strong><p>June 17th, 2013</p><div><p>Hey Lisa, can you clarify what you mean by &#8220;coming up separately&#8221;? Do you have a screenshot you can show me? Also for the 404, make sure the handle of your T&#038;C page matches up with the handle in the code.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Lisa</strong><p>June 13th, 2013</p><div><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have tried that but the text and the box are coming up separately and even though I have put my handle in for my terms and conditions page it is bringing up 404 error.</p>
<p>Please help, Thank you!</p>
</div></div><div><strong>tetchi</strong><p>June 13th, 2013</p><div><p>That&#8217;s easy enough! Instead of this:</p>
<p>&lt;input type=&#8221;checkbox&#8221; id=&#8221;agree&#8221;/&gt;<br />
&lt;label for=&#8221;agree&#8221;>I agree with the Terms and Conditions&lt;/label&gt;</p>
<p>do this:</p>
<p>&lt;input type=&#8221;checkbox&#8221; id=&#8221;agree&#8221;/&gt;<br />
&lt;label for=&#8221;agree&#8221;>I agree with the&lt;/label&gt;&lt;a href=&#8221;/pages/terms-and-conditions&#8221;&gt;Terms and Conditions&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>&#8230; where &#8220;terms-and-conditions&#8221; is the handle of your T&#038;C page. </p>
<p>Cheers 🙂</p>
<p>tetchi</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Lisa</strong><p>June 13th, 2013</p><div><p>Yes exactly that, so if they want to look at the terms and conditions, they can do so easily.<br />
Hope this makes sense.  </p>
<p>Thanks for getting back so quickly.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>tetchi</strong><p>June 13th, 2013</p><div><p>Hey Lisa! I&#8217;m glad I could help 🙂 </p>
<p>> Now I am trying to link terms and conditions information to this button.</p>
<p>By that, do you mean you&#8217;re trying to add a link to your T&#038;C page in the label for the checkbox (like this: <a href="http://take.ms/V4vSC" rel="nofollow">http://take.ms/V4vSC</a>)?</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Lisa</strong><p>June 13th, 2013</p><div><p>Thank you so much for this tutorial managed to do it.  Struggled a bit when I placed the snippet in originally I put terms and conditions then I noticed the dashes in between.  Sorted!!!  Now I am trying to link terms and conditions information  to this button.  Any ideas would be great!<br />
Thank you so much I still don&#8217;t understand how you come up with compter codes.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>tetchi</strong><p>June 9th, 2013</p><div><p>Hey Melissa, try looking for the closing  tag instead, and placing the ‘include’ right above it. So it’ll look like this:</p>
<p>{% include ‘terms-and-conditions’ %}</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Melissa Bowdoin</strong><p>June 7th, 2013</p><div><p>I can not get the last code to work in the theme.liquid can you please show me where in the script it should go. I got the first step down and that is there. I just need the other step to work.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>tetchi</strong><p>May 29th, 2013</p><div><p>@Lise thank you so much for the kind words! Glad it worked! 🙂</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Lise Andersen</strong><p>May 29th, 2013</p><div><p>As a non-programmer may I thank you from the bottom of my heart for doing a tutorial that a non-geek can understand. I just tried following your instructions, and it just worked. THANK YOU!</p>
</div></div><div><strong>tetchi</strong><p>May 24th, 2013</p><div><p>Hey Julia, try looking for the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag instead, and placing the &#8216;include&#8217; right above it. So it&#8217;ll look like this:</p>
<p>{% include &#8216;terms-and-conditions&#8217; %}<br />
&lt;/body&gt;</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Julia</strong><p>May 23rd, 2013</p><div><p>Thank you for this nice and easy tutorial!</p>
<p>However, I have some difficulties to implement the last step. I do not understand where to put the code in the theme.liquid. Everywhere I tried it, the shop gave me the error message, that it could not find the snippet.</p>
<p>So, the checkbox appears, but you can go on to check out, wheather it is checked or not.</p>
<p>Could you maybe take a look at the code if I send it to you and tell me, maybe by marking the spot, where to put it?</p>
<p>That would be great!</p>
<p>Sadly I have no idea about code, I&#8217;m following blindly.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Daniel Birch</strong><p>May 2nd, 2013</p><div><p>Worked straight out of the box, and the tutorial was easy to follow. Thanks!</p>
<p>Would it be possible to change the formatting of the box if the script returns a &#8220;fail&#8221;?<br />
I&#8217;m thinking that if the customer forgets to check the box initially, and receives the error-pop-up, the box and text would then be highlighted (e.g. red color) to show the customer where to go next&#8230;</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Meindert</strong><p>April 18th, 2013</p><div><p>Great info but I am trying to let this work on the top menu of Shopify. Like: making &#8211; I agree&#8230;&#8230; &#8211; visible just beneath the menu links -, visitor needs to check and if not, visitor is not allowed to use the menu item links. (not allowed to see info) Is this also possible with your solution? See in script:</p>
<p>jQuery(document).ready(function(){<br />
    jQuery(&#8220;.submit-cart input[type=&#8217;submit&#8217;],.submit-cart input[type=&#8217;image&#8217;]&#8221;).click(function(){<br />

        jQuery(&#8220;.submit-cart input&#8221;).submit();<br />

</div></div><div><strong>Andrea</strong><p>September 26th, 2012</p><div><p>Hi Tetsuro,</p>
<p>We are so happy to have found this tutorial which enables us to add the &#8220;I agree&#8221; checkbox (a legal requirement here in Germany)! </p>
<p>A couple of questions:</p>
<p>1. How/where we can resize the font of the &#8220;I agree with Terms &amp; Conditions&#8221; text?</p>
<p>2. Also, we&#8217;d like to have the whole text in one line, not split into 3 rows.<br />
    I guess if we try to adjust the padding or the margin (?) of &#8220;.cart_table tr td&#8221; in the style.css, that should do the trick, right?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Andrea<br />
PS: We are using Jitensha Theme &#8211; and love it!</p>

<p>What a great tutorial !</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to follow your tutorial. I&#8217;m totally new in liquid and already completing step one in the tutorial I&#8217;m stuck. I hope you can give me a hint on this..</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve have completed step 1. Adding the checkbox in cart.liquid &#8211; this is easy however the &#8220;I agree with the&#8230;&#8221;-text conflicts with my checkout button.</p>
<p>How do I make it look nice layout-wise? I guess this is very basic..but how do I add som line spacing before and after? Can you give me a clue?</p>
<p>Thank you 🙂 </p>

<p>Thanks so much</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Jonathan Hodnett</strong><p>August 28th, 2012</p><div><p>Worked perfectly! Thanks so much for the tutorial.</p>
<p>For those of you having trouble with the &#8220;update cart&#8221; button needing to have the check box checked to function, this is what worked for <a href="http://www.vedgecandle.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.vedgecandle.com</a></p>
<p>Put the code from step two around each button (Vedge Candle uses the regular checkout and PayPal) separately instead of wrapping the whole mess. I&#8217;d recommend checking your code again and if the &#8220;update cart&#8221; button is inside the the &#8230; then get it out! The screen shot for step #2 shows it inside the code, which may be causing some of these problems. That said, there may be a reason I don&#8217;t know for why it&#8217;s in there, but this is what worked for us.</p>
<p>Also, html code (<a href=" " rel="nofollow">text</a>) should work fine to link the &#8220;Terms and Conditions&#8221; text from step #1 to where ever you want it to go.</p>
<p>Thanks so much again!</p>

I need to also make sure that if the customer selects the &#8220;Checkout with PayPal Button&#8221; that the customer is also required to put a check-mark in the &#8220;I agree to Terms&#8221; checkbox. </p>
<p>Currently, if they choose the &#8220;Checkout with Paypal&#8221; Button, they are allowed to completely by-pass the &#8220;I agree to Terms&#8221; Check Box and proceed straight to the Checkout page(without having to click the Checkbox).</p>
<p>Is there some Code that I can add that requires Customers to Also have to put a check-mark in the Checkbox &#8211; before they are permitted to proceeed to the Checkout page &#8211; when they select &#8220;Checkout with Pay Pal&#8221; Button?</p>
<p>3. How to Make the Text Following the Checkbox a LINK to the actual &#8220;Terms&#8221;:<br />
Is there a way to make the &#8220;I Agree with the Terms&#8221; text &#8211; that immediately follows the checkbox &#8211; a LINK to the actual &#8220;Terms&#8221; page?</p>
<p>Making this text (after the checkbox) LINK to the actual &#8220;Terms&#8221; &#8211; would enable the Customer to read the &#8220;Terms&#8221; before s/he checked the checkbox.</p>
<p>4. Do I need to also use the &#8220;NoConflict&#8221; Script?<br />
Like Maximilliano (above in the Comments) I added   id=”checkout”  to my cart.liquid file, right after   name=”checkout” .</p>
<p>However, Unlike Maximilliano, I did NOT use/implement the &#8220;NoConflict&#8221; Script &#8211; but instead just used the &#8220;Standard&#8221; script that you first recommended in the tutorial.</p>
<p>So, do you suggest I go back now and implement/use the &#8220;No-Conflict&#8221; Script &#8211; or is it OK for me to just stick with using the &#8220;Standard&#8221; Script that  I did implement?</p>
<p>For instance, might the &#8220;No-Conflict&#8221; Script improve anything (like make the &#8220;Checkout Buttons&#8221; appear spacial-y correct on the Cart page)?</p>
<p>Much Appreciated,<br />

<p>If I have set up the checkbox so that it only shows when products with a certain tag are in the cart, how would I change the jQuery script so that it only works when the checkbox exists?</p>
<p>At the alert comes up even if the checkbox isn&#8217;t showing on the cart? (I tried adjusting the script but my javascript &amp; jQuery skills are not good enough to get it to work). </p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p>Many thanks for your script and instruction. Followed all steps and it didn&#8217;t work, then reverted to using appropriate first 4 steps and used No Conflict version at step 5, and all seems to work now, Great stuff, thanks </p>

</div></div><div><strong>Evy</strong><p>April 20th, 2012</p><div><p>Hi,<br />
thanks, this was really helpful.<br />
I seem to have the same problem as Mette, I don&#8217;t seem to get the checkbox to work. It takes me to the next step both with and without a checked box.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if you could email me the whole section from theme.liquid to see if I have placed this wrongly in the  section as I am no programmer&#8230;</p>
<p>I also need help on how to include a link to the actual Terms and Conditions in the cart, since they only appear on the next page (and its required that people actually can read them to accept them). This can be a separate popup page &#8211; have no clue on how to create this&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanxs a lot for your help!</p>
<p>Evy</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Jake</strong><p>March 3rd, 2012</p><div><p>Hi guys, I&#8217;m having the same issue as Andrew. </p>

<p>Mine does not appear to be working. Would you be able to take a look?</p>
<p>It might be that I have added 2 checkboxes?<br />

I&#8217;ve been looking for this scrip for a while, glad i came across to your site.<br />
I do have a small question, how do you remove or change the &#8220;this page at <a href="http://ABCD.myshopify.com" rel="nofollow">http://ABCD.myshopify.com</a> says&#8221; on the pop-up screen?<br />
I would rather to have my primary domain name shown, other than the shopify one.</p>

</div></div><div><strong>Andrew</strong><p>November 26th, 2011</p><div><p>Great tutorial, got it installed quickly, with only a minor bug I&#8217;m curious about.  The script runs when the customer clicks on the &#8220;Update Cart&#8221; button as well, which isn&#8217;t catastrophic, but is confusing.  If they check the box, update their cart, the checkbox returns to un-checked.  Again, not catastrophic, but confusing.  Any thoughts on a fix?</p>

</div></div><div><strong>Birgit</strong><p>October 3rd, 2011</p><div><p>Hi,<br />
I&#8217;ve following problem:<br />
I installed everything following the instruction, but now it gives me always an alert box &#8211; whatever I do. For example, if i&#8217;m adding a product to my cart it also tells me &#8220;xxx was added to your shopping cart / with an ok button&#8221;.</p>
<p>Any solution here?</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Christian O</strong><p>July 25th, 2011</p><div><p>Oi, I figured this one out myself 🙂 I works perfectly. So thankfull for this script.</p>

</div></div><div><strong>Christian O</strong><p>July 21st, 2011</p><div><p>Hi Tetsuro,</p>
<p>Great script! This is (almost) exactly what I need.</p>
<p>If I combine some of your script with &#8220;Gift wrapping&#8221; (by Caroline Schnapp) I might be able to insure that our costumers<br />
1) will add packaging<br />
and<br />
2) wont be able to remove it?</p>
<p>I was thinking about hiding the check box and making it &#8220;pre checked&#8221; &#8211; is this even possible?</p>
<p>Anyways, GREAT tutorial 🙂 Easy to understand and very well written.</p>

</div></div><div><strong>Tetsuro</strong><p>July 20th, 2011</p><div><p>Yep, that shouldn&#8217;t be an issue. However, if you&#8217;re using noConflict mode for your other scripts, make sure the script from this tutorial is in noConflict mode as well.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Daniel</strong><p>July 14th, 2011</p><div><p>Hey Tetsuro, </p>
<p>Thanks for the tutorial.  Is it possible that this won&#8217;t work if there are other jQuery scripts running on the cart? For example my store has a jQuery script for a &#8220;gift&#8221; box that, when checked, generated additional customer input boxes.  Will adding another checkbox complicate this? Thanks</p>
<p>Dan</p>
</div></div><div><strong>David</strong><p>June 22nd, 2011</p><div><p>Thanks for this Tetsuro!  I am launching my site next week and I needed this functionality built in.  I was able to add it to my site in less than 20 minutes following your step by step guide.</p>

</div></div><div><strong>Laura</strong><p>September 16th, 2010</p><div><p>Thanks so much for this. I have a lot of liability and need to have customers select this option!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m new to all this however, and can&#8217;t seem to get it to work. I think adding the # sign is the most confusing part. The Agree box has shown up, but I&#8217;m still able to go through the checkout without it checked.</p>
<p>Also, curious, where to add the text for the terms and conditions? That should be a link for another pop-up, yes?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />

</div></div><div><strong>JT</strong><p>May 19th, 2010</p><div><p>Hi Tetsuro,</p>
<p>Many thanks for the tutorial. It is working brilliantly with most browsers on our shopify site &#8211; except with Opera which happily lets you checkout whether you check the box or not. (I&#8217;m currently testing with Opera 9.2). Anything I can add to the script to get Opera to work? (I tried both scripts and both fail with Opera).</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Tetsuro</strong><p>May 12th, 2010</p><div><p>Brent: Thanks a bunch for your help and input. Do you think it&#8217;s a bad thing if pressing &#8216;enter&#8217; calls the function as well? Personally I think it&#8217;s okay to leave it as is because some people may choose to tab into the submit button and push enter.</p>
<p>Mette: Sorry I couldn&#8217;t get back to you sooner, but good to know you got your logo working. It seems like the cart page is working as well. Please let me know if you need any help.</p>
<p>CJ: Strange, it shouldn&#8217;t be refreshing anything. Can you post the URL to your store? Thanks.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>CJ</strong><p>April 19th, 2010</p><div><p>I have followed the instructions, but I am still having an issue. When you click on the go to checkout button, it just refreshes the page, no pop-up or anything.

<p>Thanks<br />

</div></div><div><strong>Mette Lykke</strong><p>April 14th, 2010</p><div><p>Btw, I solved the logo thing.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Mette Lykke</strong><p>April 14th, 2010</p><div><p>Thanks for a great tutorial!</p>
<p>I do have a problem though. The checkbox is there but not checking it does not cause a pop up. I followed the steps and read the advice above &#8211; any clues for me?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m completely new at html and would appreciate any help!</p>
<p>My store is <a href="http://shop.endomondo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://shop.endomondo.com/</a></p>

<p>Mette</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Mette Lykke</strong><p>April 13th, 2010</p><div><p>Great tutorial!</p>
<p>Do you by any chance also have one on how to insert a logo to the Minimify theme? </p>
<p>That would be really helpful too.</p>
<p>Mette</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Brent</strong><p>March 31st, 2010</p><div><p>Cool Tetsuro.  A few comments:</p>
<p>Grabbing the submit event would make the func fire on BOTH the click AND &#8216;enter&#8217; key press.   </p>
<p>example: jQuery(&#8220;#checkout&#8221;).submit(function(){</p>
<p>Also, Kevin, revisiting that input value, I think I would look for the value of the field instead of checking for null.  Like this:</p>
<p>FOR EMPTY   if(jQuery(’#kevinsNumber’).val()==&#8221;){<br />
FOR A VALUE   if(jQuery(’#kevinsNumber’).val()>=&#8217;3&#8242;){</p>
<p>cheers,<br />
~ brent</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Brent</strong><p>March 31st, 2010</p><div><p>Yo Kevin.  Instead of checking for a checked checkbox, which the answer is either yes or no, you want to look at the value of a text field input.</p>
<p>So looking above at Tetsuro&#8217;s example at the top of the page, you need to replace his live 5 with this:</p>
<p>  if(jQuery(&#8216;#kevinsNumber&#8217;).attr(&#8216;value&#8217;) == null){</p>
<p>So that will look at your input with an id=kevinsNumber, and see if it has a value.  If it does, then it will continue and submit the form on the next line.  If not his code pops a js alert.</p>
<p>If you wanted to make sure the number was at least &#8220;3&#8221; or whatever, do this:</p>
<p>  if(jQuery(&#8216;#kevinsNumber&#8217;).attr(&#8216;value&#8217;) &gt;= 3){</p>
<p>Peace out.  Hope that helps ya.<br />
~ brent</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Kevin</strong><p>March 5th, 2010</p><div><p>This is great, but not quite what I am trying to do.  I actually need to require a number in a textarea.  How do I alter this to require the text field to not be empty and to be a numerical entry?</p>

yes it works like a charm now! thank you.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Tetsuro</strong><p>November 20th, 2009</p><div><p>Hey there Philippe, greetings from Ottawa :). I think I know exactly what&#8217;s going on here. From what I see from the two screenshots, it looks like the code that you inserted (which I wrote in jQuery) is conflicting with the MooTools script that you are using for the multiple options dropdown.</p>
<p>To fix this, please use the noConflict mode script that I have above, instead of the first script. This should make it so that my script won&#8217;t make the MooTools script for multiple options go bonkers.</p>
<p>Let me know how that goes!</p>
</div></div><div><strong>philippe</strong><p>November 20th, 2009</p><div><p>hi tetsu, great tutorial and thanks for sharing. I installed it on <a href="http://www.swingcity.me" rel="nofollow">http://www.swingcity.me</a> and it works but it changed the checkout layout. you can see the screenshots here: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.de/swingcheese/FreePixs?feat=directlink" rel="nofollow">http://picasaweb.google.de/swingcheese/FreePixs?feat=directlink</a><br />

</div></div><div><strong>Maximilliano</strong><p>November 18th, 2009</p><div><p>Tetsuro,</p>
<p>Brilliant Jquery &#8211; altho I did stuble on the id=&#8221;checkout&#8221;, eventually figured to put that in my cart.liquid file, right after name=&#8221;checkout&#8221;.</p>
<p>I presumed it would just work &#8211; which it almost did.  Had to use the no conflict script, but hey &#8211; it&#8217;s great.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to write a nice, simple to follow set of rules, for us newbies!!</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Jamie</strong><p>November 18th, 2009</p><div><p>I guess you just used an if-statement that would output the checkbox only if the {{ item.product.title }} matched that of the specific product eh?</p>
<p>Exactly! Not tricky really.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Gavin Terrill</strong><p>November 9th, 2009</p><div><p>&gt; Would you recommend using noConflict mode for all themes?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>admin</strong><p>November 9th, 2009</p><div><p>Jamie: Cool thanks! Man, that does sound a bit tricky. I guess you just used an if-statement that would output the checkbox only if the {{ item.product.title }} matched that of the specific product eh?</p>
<p>Gavin: Thanks! Would you recommend using noConflict mode for all themes? I typically write jQuery code normally (with the $), but perhaps this is bad practice&#8230; I did mention noConflict mode in my write-up though 🙂 </p>
<p>Caroline: Thanks Caroline! I&#8217;m actually not very good with Javascript, so your comment was very reassuring 🙂</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Caroline Schnapp</strong><p>November 9th, 2009</p><div><p>This is beautiful jQuery code. It could not be any better. Lovely. Vert good tutorial. All details in place, very clear. Pretty too. Fun.</p>
<p>Aaaaaahhhhhhh.</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Gavin Terrill</strong><p>November 9th, 2009</p><div><p>Thanks for the tutorial Tetsuro. Nice job!</p>
</div></div><div><strong>Jamie</strong><p>November 9th, 2009</p><div><p>Nice write-up Tetsuro!<br />
I had to do this a few weeks ago for a client. Mine was a bit trickier though. This could only be present in the cart if 1 certain item was present, which required a three month recurring charge commitment. It also had to allow for a combination of that item plus other items. So I added a conditional to the class name on the checkbox for jquery to hook that would change depending on IF that one item was in the cart or not.</p>
