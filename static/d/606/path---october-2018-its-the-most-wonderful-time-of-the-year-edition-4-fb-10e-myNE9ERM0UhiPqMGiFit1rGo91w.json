The temperature drops to a nice 10-15 degrees, the leaves start to change to a beautiful red-orange-yellow hue, and most importantly the NHL season begins. This year we were also blessed with an epic UFC fight, the release of the much-anticipated video game Red Dead Redemption 2, and the legalization of weed.</p>\n\n<p>October was a really good month for sports. The Leafs had a decent start to the season, finishing the month with a 8-4-0 record. The only shitty thing was that my boy Auston Matthews got injured near the end of the month. This totally blows because I love watching him play and he&#x2019;s by far the best player on the Leafs. I&#x2019;m hoping for a speedy recovery for the kid.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 63.671875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image wp-image-7003\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"auston matthews\" title src=\"/static/174ffd6b14d3449db66fafa09f261908/a111b/auston-matthews.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/174ffd6b14d3449db66fafa09f261908/aca85/auston-matthews.jpg 163w,\n/static/174ffd6b14d3449db66fafa09f261908/0954f/auston-matthews.jpg 325w,\n/static/174ffd6b14d3449db66fafa09f261908/a111b/auston-matthews.jpg 650w,\n/static/174ffd6b14d3449db66fafa09f261908/ce471/auston-matthews.jpg 975w,\n/static/174ffd6b14d3449db66fafa09f261908/bee4e/auston-matthews.jpg 1300w,\n/static/174ffd6b14d3449db66fafa09f261908/9c49d/auston-matthews.jpg 1950w,\n/static/174ffd6b14d3449db66fafa09f261908/2b40c/auston-matthews.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\">\n  </span></figure>\n\n<p>The UFC fight between McGregor and Khabib was absolutely insane.

We rented a cottage right by the lake where we spent the weekend drinking, playing boardgames, and making tasty meals.</p>\n\n<p>One of the highlights of this trip was the hike up <a href=\"https://domainesaintbernard.org/https://domainesaintbernard.org/\">Domaine Saint Bernard</a>. The fall colours were beautiful and the view of the hills was breathtaking. Near the top we were greeted by a friendly group of chickadees. I put a bit of grass on top of Kylea&#x2019;s head to see if they&#x2019;d fly on top of her head, and lo and behold, it worked! One-by-one they would land on her toque, making for some sweet photo-ops.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.3860759493671%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAbABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQAAAwEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIFAwQG/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAC/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAFqvlu+LxJJltomXE1C/8QAHhAAAgICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQMAAhESEBQjMUL/2gAIAQEAAQUCWzWtcET5W41r2bTXxrBMzwv3P//EABcRAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQERL/2gAIAQMBAT8ByR//xAAYEQACAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARAREv/aAAgBAgEBPwHRan//xAAcEAACAgIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEAAhERJBUYH/2gAIAQEABj8CuAvX2cI56pB//8QAGhABAQEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARIUFRof/aAAgBAQABPyF+/ep8uinbbcT3CCYGPqj15q3mNhUrEvdhf//aAAwDAQACAAMAAAAQKNCO/8QAGBEAAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERMRD/2gAIAQMBAT8Qi4ULHz//xAAYEQEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABARMf/aAAgBAgEBPxAeUPQmk//EABwQAAIDAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExUWGBQf/aAAgBAQABPxBJwAukCSfagUcEEE9xQdPgqC4aFCTxDTNEU/BPgB5NUsQeAQsNBUJo9Q8htriVjwGGDNcwiwT/2Q==&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image wp-image-6994\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"kylea with chickadee\" title src=\"/static/ca5bfe1ff87f16c36330a561c3637a3b/a111b/kylea-with-chickadee.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/ca5bfe1ff87f16c36330a561c3637a3b/aca85/kylea-with-chickadee.jpg 163w,\n/static/ca5bfe1ff87f16c36330a561c3637a3b/0954f/kylea-with-chickadee.jpg 325w,\n/static/ca5bfe1ff87f16c36330a561c3637a3b/a111b/kylea-with-chickadee.jpg 650w,\n/static/ca5bfe1ff87f16c36330a561c3637a3b/ce471/kylea-with-chickadee.jpg 975w,\n/static/ca5bfe1ff87f16c36330a561c3637a3b/4831d/kylea-with-chickadee.jpg 1264w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\">\n  </span><figcaption>Kylea and her new chickadee friend. &#x1F426;</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n<p>Finally, a great event occurred on October 18th; Canada legalized marijuana!

I picked up a lot of techniques and best practices, and in the case of GraphQL learned a ton about queries and mutations.</p>\n\n<p>To get myself up to speed I decided to do some extracurricular GraphQL learning. I found the free tutorial series below by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg\">The Net Ninja</a>&#xA0;to be extremely helpful.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iK6Qhn-QLcXCXPQUov1U7f\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p>The content was exactly what I was looking for and the length of the videos were just right (informative, but not too long). The tutorials did a solid job explaining how to communicate between the Node server (backend) and the React app (frontend), which was something I was really curious about.</p>\n\n<p>On a side note, I friggin&#x2019; love how some people put out videos like this for free. I felt like I&#x2019;d be cheating him by not offering anything in return, so I made sure to send a little donation after I was done.</p>\n\n<p>All in all I felt like I made some great strides in my FED journey and I&#x2019;m happy to be getting more familiar with these new libraries and languages. Gotta keep the momentum going!</p>\n\n<h2>What I&#x2019;ve been playing</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image wp-image-7064\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"spider man ps4 hero 1\" title src=\"/static/724526ac9b60a80682fd438c71e0539a/a111b/spider-man-ps4-hero-1.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/724526ac9b60a80682fd438c71e0539a/aca85/spider-man-ps4-hero-1.jpg 163w,\n/static/724526ac9b60a80682fd438c71e0539a/0954f/spider-man-ps4-hero-1.jpg 325w,\n/static/724526ac9b60a80682fd438c71e0539a/a111b/spider-man-ps4-hero-1.jpg 650w,\n/static/724526ac9b60a80682fd438c71e0539a/ce471/spider-man-ps4-hero-1.jpg 975w,\n/static/724526ac9b60a80682fd438c71e0539a/bee4e/spider-man-ps4-hero-1.jpg 1300w,\n/static/724526ac9b60a80682fd438c71e0539a/8179c/spider-man-ps4-hero-1.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\">\n  </span></figure>\n\n<p>Last month I picked up the new <em>Spider-Man</em> game for PS4 and I had a chance to complete it this month. I knew going in that I would like this game as it borrows a lot from Rocksteady&#x2019;s <em>Batman: Arkham</em> series, which I absolutely loved. I was stoked to finally play a AAA Spider-Man game as he is my all-time favourite superhero.</p>\n\n<p>What I loved most about&#xA0;<em>Spider-Man</em> was the web-swinging mechanic. Zipping around the massive New York City map was so damn satisfying. The game offers fast travel between points on the map, but not once did I use it. Having just gone to New York City for the <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/august-2018-big-30-in-nyc-edition/\">first time in August</a>, I had a really fun time zippin&#x2019; around looking for famous landmarks. &#x1F5FD;</p>\n\n<p>My only gripe with <em>Spider-Man</em> was that the boss fights were too easy.

The book covers the development of ten video games and the many challenges the developers faced. It seemed like a miracle that some of these games ever saw the light of day!</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 430px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 150.69767441860466%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image wp-image-6972\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"blood sweat pixels cover\" title src=\"/static/7757de287d4840facb5fa8cc3b698f85/33697/blood-sweat-pixels-cover.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/7757de287d4840facb5fa8cc3b698f85/aca85/blood-sweat-pixels-cover.jpg 163w,\n/static/7757de287d4840facb5fa8cc3b698f85/0954f/blood-sweat-pixels-cover.jpg 325w,\n/static/7757de287d4840facb5fa8cc3b698f85/33697/blood-sweat-pixels-cover.jpg 430w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\">\n  </span></figure></div>\n\n<p>I enjoyed reading about the games that I&#x2019;ve played in the past, which were The Witcher 3, Stardew Valley, Diablo 3, and Destiny. It was cool to learn about the roadblocks they had to overcome such as&#xA0;technical difficulties, creative blocks, time constraints, publisher pressure, and more.</p>\n\n<p>The story that stuck with me the most was the development of the 2016 farm simulator <a href=\"https://stardewvalley.net/\"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a>. When I moved to Montreal a couple of years ago and wasn&#x2019;t socializing much, I sunk over a hundred hours into this game. Little did I know that this addictive and insanely polished game was made by a single person. The developer, Eric Barone, did all of the programming, artwork, music, etc. all on his own! Reading about the ups and downs of&#xA0;<em>Stardew Valley</em>&#x2018;s development made me appreciate the game even more.</p>\n\n<p>A common theme in the book was how a lot of video game developers go through an insane amount of &#x201C;crunch time&#x201D; where they work an inhumane amount (100+ hours a week) for as long as a year to meet deadlines. It was timely too as <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466\">many articles</a> had popped up about the insane amount of crunch that went into the development of Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>\n\n<p> I&#x2019;d read about this before in gaming news sites, but did not realize just how bad and common it was. I can&#x2019;t even imagine what it must be like to spend every waking moment towards your work with no time for family or extra activities. I really hope the video game industry can overcome this in the future.</p>\n\n<p><em>Blood, Sweat, and Pixels</em>&#xA0;was a great read and made me appreciate video games even more. Every gamer should read this book.&#xA0;</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n<p>If I could rate this past October I would give it a solid A+.
