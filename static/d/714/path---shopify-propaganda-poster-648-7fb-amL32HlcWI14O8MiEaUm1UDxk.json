{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Shopify Propaganda Poster","content":"<p>\t\t\t\tAt Shopify, we have &#8220;design challenges&#8221; every now and then. This week&#8217;s challenge was to create a propaganda poster. Below is the poster that I designed, I&#8217;m pretty proud of it ðŸ™‚ </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/shopify_propaganda.jpg\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/shopify_propaganda-454x588.jpg\" alt=\"Shopify Propaganda\" title=\"shopify_propaganda\" width=\"454\" height=\"588\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1709\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Shopify Propaganda Poster</div>\n<p> <!--more--> </p>\n<h3>Inspiration:</h3>\n<p>I looked at a lot of American posters from World War II for inspiration. I&#8217;ve always loved propaganda posters, especially how they make everything sound really imperative. I also liked how they mixed sans-serif fonts with script fonts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Get-Hot-Keep-Moving1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Get Hot - Keep Moving\" width=\"237\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1716\" srcset=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Get-Hot-Keep-Moving1.jpeg 237w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Get-Hot-Keep-Moving1-203x300.jpeg 203w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">One of my inspirations</div>\n<p>Overall I think I was able to pull off a pretty legit-looking propaganda poster. It was a good exercise for learning blend modes as well. </p>\n<p>THE END\t\t</p>\n","wordpress_id":1704},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Hey Jamie!
