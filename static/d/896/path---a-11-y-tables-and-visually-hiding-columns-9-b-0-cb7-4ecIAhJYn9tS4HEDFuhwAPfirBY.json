{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"VoiceOver, tables and visually hiding columns","content":"<p>\t\t\t\tI was working more on tables when I ran into another weird issue in VoiceOver. I needed to visually hide a column in a table, but <strong>not</strong> use <code>display: none</code> so that it could still be accessible by screen readers.</p>\n<p>I tried out the <a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/css/invisiblecontent/#absolutepositioning\">&#8220;position content off-screen&#8221;</a> technique outlined by WebAim.org, and that worked great until I started testing in VoiceOver.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Shown below is a gif of me navigating through a regular table, and doing the <code>VO + C</code> command to read out the column header. Since I&#8217;m not hiding anything in the table below, the command worked as expected.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/before-visually-hiding-column.gif\" alt=\"before visually hiding column\"></p>\n<p>Next, I visually hid a column and then tried the same command. I could navigate every cell in the hidden column just fine, but when I did <code>VO + C</code>, it would  <strong>read the header of the column immediately next to it</strong>. Notice how in the gif below, it reads &#8220;Column 2&#8221; instead of &#8220;Column 1&#8221; even though I&#8217;m focused on the first column.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/after-visually-hiding-column.gif\" alt=\"after visually hiding column\"></p>\n<p>I guess the lesson here is to be very thorough when testing for accessibility, and to not forget about <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/voiceover/info/guide/_1131.html\">keyboard commands</a>. I imagine it&#8217;d be pretty frustrating and disorienting for a screen reader user if they are not able to quickly tell which column they are on.</p>\n<h3>What did I do instead?</h3>\n<p>To get around this, I ended up using <code>text-indent: -9999px</code> to move the text off-screen. Doing this did not break the <code>VO + C</code> command. You can see in the gif below that the proper table header is read in the first column.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/text-indenting-columns.gif\" alt=\"text indenting columns\"></p>\n<p>Now this technique still preserves the width of the column, but in my case this was okay because I was overlaying another table on top of where the empty space is (more on that in a future blog post!).</p>\n<h3>Codepen Demo</h3>\n<p data-height=\"331\" data-theme-id=\"0\" data-slug-hash=\"dGrzrP\" data-default-tab=\"result\" data-user=\"tetchi\" class=\"codepen\">See the Pen <a href=\"http://codepen.io/tetchi/pen/dGrzrP/\">Visually hiding a column</a> by Tetsuro Takara (<a href=\"http://codepen.io/tetchi\">@tetchi</a>) on <a href=\"http://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.</p>\n<p><script async=\"\" src=\"//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js\"></script>\t\t</p>\n","wordpress_id":4777},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"a11y-tables-and-visually-hiding-columns","wordpressId":4777,"newerPostSlug":"accessibility-improvements-to-my-blog","olderPostSlug":"japan-trip-2015-conclusion"}}
