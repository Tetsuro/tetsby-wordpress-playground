{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"New Design (Now with Responsive Goodness!)","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>A few months ago I stumbled across this awesome book called <a href=\"http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design\">Responsive Web Design</a>. No lies, this book seriously changed my life. It changed the way I looked at websites, and I was absolutely fascinated by the way media queries and responsive web sites work. I found myself looking at responsive websites and resizing the browser window for hours on end seeing how the site adjusted to the viewport size.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 500px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image alignnone size-full wp-image-1811\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Ethan Marcotte&apos;s Responsive Web Design\" title=\"Responsive Web Design\" src=\"/static/0948db59cdc79bc300b81bb44279e387/48a11/responsive.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/0948db59cdc79bc300b81bb44279e387/aca85/responsive.jpg 163w,\n/static/0948db59cdc79bc300b81bb44279e387/0954f/responsive.jpg 325w,\n/static/0948db59cdc79bc300b81bb44279e387/48a11/responsive.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n  </span></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Are you remotely interested in web design? Do you like smartphones? FUCKING BUY THIS BOOK.</div>\n<p>That&#x2019;s why I spent the last month or so working on a responsive web site that I could call my own. At the same time I decided to &#x2018;re-brand&#x2019; my site to &#x201C;tetchi&#x201D; (my nickname since I was a kid) because it sounds way more wicked than &#x201C;tetsutakara&#x201D;. Today, I&#x2019;m releasing my responsive web site out in the wild!</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m currently working on a boilerplate for Shopify, which is based off of the excellent <a href=\"http://html5boilerplate.com/\" title=\"HTML 5 Boilerplate\">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. The goal is to make it easier for Shopify theme authors to start building a theme from scratch. I then plan on building a super-basic theme with it and an up-to-date &#x201C;How to build a theme from scratch&#x201D; screencast for it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope my first responsive website works as it should. Please leave a comment if it looks funky on your device!</p>\n<p><strong>PS:</strong> I may have lost some recent comments as I transitioned to this new site&#x2026; sorry! Please leave another comment and I&#x2019;ll try to get back to you.</p>\n</body></html>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"new-design-now-responsive"}}
