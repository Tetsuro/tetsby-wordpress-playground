{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Battlefield 3","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>\t\t\t\tFor the past couple of months I&#x2019;ve been hooked on DICE&#x2019;s latest game, Battlefield 3 (BF3). I was a huge fan of Battlefield 1942 so I knew that I would love BF3 right off the bat. </p>\n<p>BF3 is the <strong>best FPS I&#x2019;ve ever played</strong>. Between BF1942 and BF3, I played a lot of FPS games but most of them were short-lived. One exception is TF2, which I played a lot until it went crazy with all the hats, crafting and micro-transactions.</p>\n<p>One of BF3&#x2019;s great new features is &#x201C;Battlelog&#x201D;, which is EA&#x2019;s social platform for BF3 players. The best part about Battlelog is its stat-tracking. Through Battlelog you can check your kill:death ratio, weapon stats, unlocks, awards, and reports of past rounds. I find myself logging into Battlelog after rounds to see how I did, and whether or not I&#x2019;m about to unlock something. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tetchi_bf3_stats-e1325197150463.png\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tetchi_bf3_stats-e1325197150463.png\" alt=\"my bf3 stats\" title=\"my bf3 stats\" width=\"500\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1964\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tetchi_bf3_stats-e1325197150463.png 500w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tetchi_bf3_stats-e1325197150463-300x276.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Battlelog provides you with lots of sweet stats</div>\n<p>As for the actual gameplay, what makes BF3 so awesome is its emphasis on teamwork. This was made even more true when I was one day recruited by a platoon called <a href=\"http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655391303178979/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"N7 Spectres platoon page\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">N7 Spectres</a>. I was asked to join when I was having a pretty sweet game on Noshahr Canals. I was a little worried at first because I thought that being in a platoon meant daily practices and getting super-pissed at one another for messing up, but man, how wrong I was. N7 Spectres is a group of some of the coolest, friendliest and most importantly skilled players, and it makes playing BF3 even more fun.</p>\n<p>N7 Spectre&#x2019;s founder, eGessDub, posts some pretty sweet gameplay videos on his Youtube channel <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/EssDubGaming?blend=1&amp;ob=video-mustangbase\" title=\"essDubgaming youtube\">here</a>. Yesterday eGessDub posted a game with me in it! It&#x2019;s pretty rad to re-experience the match from another person&#x2019;s perspective. </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/TPG9ykEBjSQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">eGessDub&#x2019;s latest replay video. Tearin&#x2019; it up on Seine Crossing!</div>\n<p><!--more--><br>\nKnifing people in BF3 is seriously a metagame, and it&#x2019;s one of my favourite aspects of the game. When you perform a knife attack from behind an enemy, you go into this wicked animation where you grab your enemy&#x2019;s dog tag and stab him in the heart/throat. Knifing can be pretty difficult though, as it makes you vulnerable to nearby enemies, and the knife animation doesn&#x2019;t kick in all the time (it&#x2019;s a little buggy IMO). This makes performing a knife kill all the more satisfying. </p>\n<p>This has developed into an unhealthy addiction for me, as I&#x2019;ll go out of my way to run behind an enemy and snatch his dog tag. Within Battlelog, there&#x2019;s a section to see all of the stolen dog tags, and it has become my very own <a href=\"http://images.wikia.com/avp/images/f/f8/Trophywall-1-.jpg\">trophy room</a> like in  the movie <em>Predators</em>. The other week I lucked out and <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dog-tags.png\" title=\"DICE dog tag\"> stole a dog tag from a DICE developer.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/jafjX.jpg\"></a></p><div class=\" gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%\" data-reactroot><div style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:62.5%\"></div><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/jafjX.jpg\"><img src=\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\" alt style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition-delay:500ms\"><picture><img sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" srcset=\"/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/aca85/jafjX.jpg 163w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/0954f/jafjX.jpg 325w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/a111b/jafjX.jpg 650w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/ce471/jafjX.jpg 975w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/bee4e/jafjX.jpg 1300w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/dde36/jafjX.jpg 1680w\" src=\"/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/a111b/jafjX.jpg\" alt style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"></picture><noscript><picture><img sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" srcset=\"/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/aca85/jafjX.jpg 163w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/0954f/jafjX.jpg 325w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/a111b/jafjX.jpg 650w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/ce471/jafjX.jpg 975w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/bee4e/jafjX.jpg 1300w,\n/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/dde36/jafjX.jpg 1680w\" src=\"/static/b30c039251d0771d0d2651e74c5ce8ce/a111b/jafjX.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></a></div><p></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">A screencap of the knifing animation.
