{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Lessons from moving","content":"<p>\t\t\t\tIt&#8217;s already been about two months since I moved to Montreal, and I&#8217;ve learned a lot about myself during this time. In this post I share some things I&#8217;ve learned after moving to a new city for the first time.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>I own too much shit</h2>\n<p>Before the move to Montreal I got rid of as many possessions as possible. I sold anything that was collecting dust, including my XBOX 360, one of my unused bass guitars, air conditioner, etc. I also donated four garbage bags full of old clothes.</p>\n<p>Even with all of this effort, I was shocked at how much stuff I had to load into the U-Haul on moving day. I just <em>barely</em> fit everything into the truck, and I was pretty disappointed about this.</p>\n<p>Ever since, I&#8217;ve been more conscious about buying <em>anything</em> that would take up space in my apartment. When I want to buy something, I ask myself the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much physical space will it take up?</li>\n<li>How easy is it to pack for future moves?</li>\n<li>Will it replace something that I already have? </li>\n<li>Will I still want to buy this thing after a week? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asking myself these questions on a constant basis should hopefully prevent me from hoarding unnecessary junk. Having less things will make future moves so much easier.</p>\n<h2>I need to do a better job tracking my spendings</h2>\n<p>Moving to a new city got me thinking about how much I pay for rent, utilities, and other necessities; and that triggered me into thinking about how much money I spend on non-essential items.</p>\n<p>I started using an app called <a href=\"http://wally.me/\">Wally</a>, and it&#8217;s <em>fantastic</em>. It&#8217;s really simple; you enter in your monthly income, and every time you spend money you just punch in an amount and a category. The app then gives you an idea of what you&#8217;re spending on and how much money you have left for the month.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/iphone-base.png\" alt=\"wally mobile app\" />\n</p>\n<p>There are more automated solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/canada\">Mint</a>, but I actually prefer Wally&#8217;s manual approach. Manual input makes me think more about every dollar I spend, and it&#8217;s nice to see how much money I have left in the month. It almost gamifies the process and encourages me to save more.</p>\n<h2>Writing tasks down helps me destress</h2>\n<p>While planning the move, I often stressed myself out thinking about all of the stuff I needed to do. Switching my insurance, transferring my driver&#8217;s license and health card&#8230; and so on. I&#8217;d toss and turn in bed worrying that I&#8217;d forgotten or overlooked something important.</p>\n<p>To remedy this, I started writing down tasks in my handy dandy notebook. Writing tasks down helped me better retain them in my head. Even if there wasn&#8217;t anything I could do about an upcoming task at a given point in time, I took comfort in knowing that I&#8217;d be reminded of it by my notebook when certain prerequisites were met.</p>\n<p style='text-align: center;'>\n<img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_7192.jpg\" alt=\"Notebook snapshot\" />\n</p>\n<p>I tried using one of many to-do apps for this, but I much prefer notebooks. This might sounds odd, but the feeling of <em>physically</em> crossing something off a list is insanely satisfying to me. Tapping a checkbox just doesn&#8217;t do it.</p>\n<h2>Hobbies are dope and I need more of them in my life</h2>\n<p>More than ever I feel a deep appreciation for activities outside of work. This is probably because I&#8217;m looking for ways to meet new people.</p>\n<p>For example, I love playing soccer. I played in various leagues with my friends and coworkers back in Ottawa, and was jonesin&#8217; to find new people to play with. A few Saturdays ago a couple of coworkers and I biked down to Parc Jeanne Mance to play pick-up soccer with a bunch of random dudes. After the game we introduced ourselves to some of the other players, and we&#8217;re now  part of a WhatsApp group of 50+ dudes that get together at the park to play soccer.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I reached out to a guy on Kijiji looking for a jazz bassist for jazz jams. I&#8217;ve been working on my upright bass chops for a while now and have been looking for jazz musicians to jam with. I&#8217;ve since been to several jazz jams at La Brassette and was able to meet some really cool musicians. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to learn what I need to work on too; for example, I learned that my bass soloing skills still need a lot of work.</p>\n<p>Moving to a new city has also been a great opportunity to discover new hobbies. As it turns out there&#8217;s a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym right across from my place, so I&#8217;ve been training there for a few weeks now. I made friends with some people who were also just getting started, and we&#8217;re going to be getting together at the gym weekly to train. I hope to get to a level where I won&#8217;t always get my ass handed to me during sparring drills.</p>\n<h2>After Montreal, I&#8217;d love to move to a new country</h2>\n<p>I love everything about Montreal so far. But let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s not exactly that far from my hometown Ottawa. I still have this itch to live somewhere totally different.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy that I moved away from Ottawa, but my move is pretty bush league compared to my friends and coworkers who have moved halfway across the world. I don&#8217;t really know where I&#8217;d want to live after Montreal. Go back to my roots, in Japan? New Zealand seems pretty cool. France seems pretty rad, too. For now I&#8217;m going to enjoy the crap out of Montreal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Thanks for reading! If you&#8217;re in Montreal and want to meet up for a drink, give me a shout üçª\t\t</p>\n","wordpress_id":5115},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Ohhh I checked out YNAB too, actually!

I&#8217;ve been using YNAB for the past while for budgeting and have been really liking it.</p>\n<p>I totally agree with the manual entry of purchases. I used to use Mint but found that my attitude was very &#8220;reactionary&#8221;. &#8220;Ah crap, I spent X at coffee shops&#8230;.hopefully I don&#8217;t do that next month&#8221;. I feel that a lot of that was due to the automated nature of it. I didn&#8217;t really have to come face to face with my purchases.</p>\n<p>In YNAB, there&#8217;s an automated feature but I purposefully don&#8217;t use it as the manual entry really makes you come to terms with where your money went. I&#8217;m feeling much more pro-active now and in control.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be curious to see how you find Wally a few months down the line!
