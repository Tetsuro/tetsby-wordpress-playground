I&#8217;ve been to Japan many times before, but this trip was different in that I went to three cities that I&#8217;ve never been to before: Fukuoka, Osaka and Kyoto.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">Fukuoka</h2>\n<p>I started off in Fukuoka, where my cousin was holding his wedding. I soldiered through the jetlag and alcohol to celebrate with friends and family. He&#8217;s not only my cousin, but a long-time friend that I grew up with in Ottawa. I&#8217;m so super happy for him and his wife! ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/Zjs2TiEt3r/\"><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wedding.jpg\" alt=\"wedding\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3364\" srcset=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wedding.jpg 612w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wedding-150x150.jpg 150w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wedding-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Fukuoka reminded me of Tokyo, but much more compact and less people. It was really easy to get around and the <a href=\"http://style.welovetenjin.com/\">Tenjin</a> area downtown was super-cool. I also had some of the best ramen I&#8217;ve ever had in my goddamn life in Fukuoka.</p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">Osaka</h2>\n<p>After spending a couple of days in Fukuoka, I headed over to Osaka with the crew. We stayed smack downtown in America-mura, Shinsaibashi.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/osaka_americamura.jpg\" alt=\"osaka americamura\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3335\" srcset=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/osaka_americamura.jpg 1024w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/osaka_americamura-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/osaka_americamura-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Walking around in America-mura, Shinsaibashi, Osaka</div>\n<p>Osaka was nuts &#8211; there&#8217;s just so much going on. All the people, billboards, bright lights and the hostess girls that try to pick you up will make your head spin.</p>\n<div class=\"clearfix\">\n<div class=\"left fifty\">\n<p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/ZmTIzqEtzh/\"><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/osaka-.jpg\" alt=\"osaka\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3367\" srcset=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/osaka-.jpg 612w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/osaka--150x150.jpg 150w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/osaka--300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right fifty\">\n<p>Osaka was also a lot grungier and more &#8216;hip&#8217; than other Japanese cities I&#8217;ve been to. There was more litter and gum stains on the streets (not cool), and when we were drinking in the park at night a group of skaters entertained us with some pretty rad tricks (super cool). Listening to the locals speak in Kansai dialect was really cool.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"step\">Kyoto</h2>\n<p>I think Kyoto is my new favourite place in the world. It&#8217;s just so&#8230; pristine and full of history. The streets and train stations were insanely clean, a huge contrast from Osaka.</p>\n<div class=\"clearfix\">\n<div class=\"left fifty\">\n<p>We checked out three temples &#038; shrines that day: Kinkakuji temple, Kiyomizudera yemple, Fushimi Inari shrine. My favourite was the Fushimi Inari shrine. Seeing the long path with hundres and hundreds of torii (gates) for the first time was a surreal experience. </p>\n<p>We were only in Kyoto for half a day so we really only hit the tip of the iceberg. There are so many more temples and shrines that I need to check out. I&#8217;m definitely going to make another trip there the next time I go to Japan. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right fifty\">\n<p><a href=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kyoto.jpg\"><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kyoto.jpg\" alt=\"kyoto\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3348\" srcset=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kyoto.jpg 612w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kyoto-150x150.jpg 150w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/kyoto-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"step\">Afterthoughts</h2>\n<p>Really going to miss Japan. It was a short trip but it was jam-packed with fun, great food, alcohol, and new experiences. I&#8217;m back in Narita now, just chilling at the airport&#8230; I might try and finish up the next parts for the <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-theme-from-scratch/\">Shopify Theme from Scratch</a> tutorials.</p>\n<p>Going to fly home to Ottawa in a bit, then Florida on Monday for <a href=\"http://cssconf.com/\">CSS Conf</a>.
