{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Reading Week","content":"<p>Back in January, I returned to Carleton University to resume my studies after a 1-year work term at Shopify. This week is Reading Week, and I&#8217;m temporarily back at Shopify to do some work. It&#8217;s really nice to be back in the office, although it makes me want to drop out of school and stay here forever ðŸ˜›</p>\n<p>School&#8217;s been pretty hectic. MEL Scripting, marketing, and product design methodology have all been keeping me pretty busy. Because of this, I won&#8217;t be writing any Shopify-related tutorials during the semester, but I hope to get back into it during the summer. </p>\n<p>There is one class that I really enjoy at school, taught by an awesome new teacher called James Acres. He introduced us to the world of <a href=\"http://processing.org/\">Processing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.arduino.cc/\">Arduino</a>, and it&#8217;s like discovering Lego again for the first time. It&#8217;s our first time creating interactions between the physical and digital world, and it&#8217;s truly been a fascinating experience. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><object width=\"400\" height=\"225\"><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=8612857&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" /><embed src=\"http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=8612857&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\"></embed></object></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">This is an example of the cool things you can do with Processing and the Reactivision framework</div>\n<p>March is going to be one tough month with all the assignments and whatnot, but I think it&#8217;ll go by quickly.
