{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"New Design!","content":"<p>Just today I launched the new design of my blog. I had been upset over my old design for a while; I couldn&#8217;t really put my finger on why, but I just felt that the design was really messy and unprofessional. One of things that REALLY bugged me is that the colours looked awful on Windows machines. For the new design, I decided to play it safe and stick with mostly grayscale colours. </p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/old_design.png\" alt=\"old_design\" title=\"old_design\" width=\"588\" height=\"378\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-667 lazy-load\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/old_design.png 588w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/old_design-300x192.png 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/old_design-466x300.png 466w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">The old design&#8230;ew!!</div>\n<p>I grabbed the background pattern that I created last year, and used it as a foundation of the new design. I didn&#8217;t want it to be too distracting so I toned down its opacity quite a bit. I&#8217;d like to work on a new background sometime soon because I feel this one is a bit too disorganized.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/repeat_Bg.jpg\" alt=\"repeat_Bg\" title=\"repeat_Bg\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-681 lazy-load\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/repeat_Bg.jpg 450w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/repeat_Bg-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/repeat_Bg-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" />\n</p>\n<div class=\"sub\">My repeatable background pattern</div>\n<p>I went through various variations of the design, getting feedback from friends and coworkers. <a href=\"http://markdunkley.com/\">Mark Dunkley</a> gave me a lot of quality feedback, as usual. I really liked the idea of having a 100% width &lt;div&gt;&#8217;s for the headers and footers. Later on I felt that having multiple &lt;div&gt;&#8217;s spanning across the page was a bit overkill, so I decided to keep it for just the footer.</p>\n<p>Big props to Steve Hatcher&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.cssstickyfooter.com/\" title=\"CSS Sticky Footer\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Sticky Footer</a>, which I&#8217;m using using for this site. I can&#8217;t even think of how much time I would have spent if I were to figure out how to make a sticky footer on my own. Thank you, Mr. Hatcher!!</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/old_design2.png\" alt=\"old_design2\" title=\"old_design2\" width=\"588\" height=\"378\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-687 lazy-load\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/old_design2.png 588w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/old_design2-300x192.png 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/old_design2-466x300.png 466w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">An earlier version of the new design</div>\n<p>I think now I can finally say that I&#8217;m content with the design of my blog. Any feedback/comments would be greatly appreciated! I also have a pretty kick-ass Shopify tutorial coming up, so stay tuned!</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE (11/20/2009):</strong> Taking Caroline&#8217;s advice, I decided to make it so that my logo is only present on the index page. This should make it easier for visitors with smaller laptops to browse my site :). Also, created a <a href=\"http://blog.tetsutakara.com/asdfasfda\">404 page.</a></p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"new-design"}}
