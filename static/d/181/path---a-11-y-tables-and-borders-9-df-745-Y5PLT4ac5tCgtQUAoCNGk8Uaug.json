{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"a11y: Tables and Borders","content":"<p>The past few weeks at work I&#8217;ve been working a lot with tables. I was testing for accessibility using <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/ca/accessibility/osx/voiceover/\">VoiceOver</a> when I ran into an interesting discovery.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>To preface, tables can be categorized into two types: <strong>layout</strong> tables and <strong>data</strong> tables. Layout tables are used to position elements around (not really a thing anymore, thank God). Data tables are for presenting tabular data. In VoiceOver, a data table with proper markup will appear under the &#8220;Tables&#8221; rotor menu, as shown in the screenshot below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/table-voiceover.png\" alt=\"Table in Voiceover\"></p>\n<p>To try this out, you can go to any page with a data table (such as <a href=\"http://s.codepen.io/tetchi/debug/bEwVBV\">this</a> one), and press <code>cmd + f5</code> to activate VoiceOver. Hit <code>ctrl + alt + u</code> to bring up the rotor, and use the left and right arrows to navigate to the Tables rotor menu.</p>\n<p>The table that I was working on did not have any table headers by design, which is a no-no according to <a href=\"http://webaim.org/techniques/tables/data#th\">WebAIM&#8217;s guidelines</a>. For this reason I totally expected VoiceOver to view my tables as a layout table, and that it would not appear in the Tables rotor menu.</p>\n<p>To my surprise, the table <strong>did</strong> appear in the rotor menu! You can see for yourself in this <a href=\"http://s.codepen.io/tetchi/debug/BjLNwv\">CodePen</a> and in the gif below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://s.codepen.io/tetchi/debug/bEwVBV\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/table.gif\" alt=\"table\"></a></p>\n<p>I was a bit stumped, so I asked my coworker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/newtron\">Dave</a> for his thoughts. He suggested that maybe the border between the rows had something to do with it. So I went back to CodePen, removed the borders, and turned on VoiceOver. Lo and behold, the table no longer showed up in VoiceOver! CodePen demo <a href=\"http://s.codepen.io/tetchi/debug/BjLNwv\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://s.codepen.io/tetchi/debug/BjLNwv\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/table_no_border.gif\" alt=\"table_no_border\"></a></p>\n<h3>What about transparent borders?</h3>\n<p>Just for fun, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kpeatt\">Kyle</a> wanted to see what would happen if you set the border&#8217;s colour to <code>transparent</code>. Funny enough, tables with <code>transparent</code> borders are still picked up by VoiceOver as data tables.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/transparent_border.png\" alt=\"Table with transparent borders\"></p>\n<h3>TLDR</h3>\n<p>VoiceOver uses borders as a criteria to determine if a table is a data table or not. Thus you <em>could</em> have a data table without any headers, though that&#8217;s not recommended.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only tested this in VoiceOver in Chrome and Safari, but I&#8217;m curious to see if other screen readers such as JAWS behave in a similar fashion. Give me a shout or leave a comment if you know!</p>\n<p>Shoutouts to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/newtron\">Dave</a> for his help and insights on this topic!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>UPDATE: 02/07/2015:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/handcoding\">@handcoding</a> on Twitter linked me to a couple of pages that explain how Chrome and Firefox determine if a table is a data table or a layout table.
