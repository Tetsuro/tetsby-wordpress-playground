Ottawa is a fantastic city and all, but I&#x2019;d hate myself forever if I don&#x2019;t live somewhere else in my life. I want to throw myself into new territory and discover the goods and bads of Montreal.</p>\n<p>Second, I want to up my French game. I&#x2019;ve been doing some French writing here and there to practice, but I&#x2019;m excited to actually <em>talk</em> to people. There&#x2019;s no better way to learn a language than to surround yourself with people who speak it.</p>\n<p>Finally, I&#x2019;ve been trying to transition to a lifestyle with less material possessions, and moving is a pretty good way to force that. I&#x2019;ve gotten rid of a bunch of clothes, video games, etc. in preparation for the move, and I&#x2019;ve got to say it feels pretty damn good!</p>\n<h2>Things I&#x2019;ll miss about Ottawa</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Castle Shawarma</li>\n<li>Chez Lucien</li>\n<li>Atomic Rooster brunch</li>\n<li>Having an underground parking spot</li>\n<li>Playing soccer with my crew</li>\n<li>Friends and my parents </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The good thing about Montreal is that it&#x2019;s only a two hour drive away. If I ever find myself jonesin&#x2019; for dat spicy garlic sauce I could always drive down.</p>\n<h2>Where in Montreal will I be?</h2>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll be setting up camp in Mile End, which apparently is <a href=\"http://www.mtlblog.com/2016/03/montreal-mile-end-mile-ex/\">a pretty cool area</a>. It looks like I&#x2019;ll be a stones throw away from a bunch of cool cafes, bars, and bagels. I&#x2019;m also dangerously close to my go-to tattoo shop.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I&#x2019;m so stoked for the move and to explore the different parts of this beautiful city.</p>\n<p>Smell ya later Ottawa, it&#x2019;s been a blast! &#x1F44B;\t\t</p>\n</body></html>","wordpress_id":4963},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>You guys are gonna miss the hell out of me.</p>\n","author_name":"tetchi","date":"June 24th, 2016"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>Cool story.</p>\n","author_name":"K","date":"June 24th, 2016"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>k bai</p>\n","author_name":"K_______","date":"June 23rd, 2016"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>Goooood riddance!!!</p>\n","author_name":"G_______","date":"June 23rd, 2016"}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"adios-ottawa","wordpressId":4963,"newerPostSlug":"francais-friday-02-au-revoir-ottawa","olderPostSlug":"francais-friday-01"}}
