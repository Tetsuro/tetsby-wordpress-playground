We&#8217;d been looking since May and we were ecstatic to finally settle on one üòÅ</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say I was nervous as hell. It was by far the biggest purchase I&#8217;d ever made, and I couldn&#8217;t help doubting my decision and asking myself questions like &#8220;is this really worth it? What sort of things could go wrong? What if Hurricane Neddy swoops down and wrecks the house?&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These doubts were soon squashed with the excitement of having a place to call our own. Adios, neighbours who walk way too fucking loud!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t move in until late December so we&#8217;ve got some time to prepare. I&#8217;m going to miss living in the Mile End; most of all, I&#8217;ll miss the Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ) gym where I&#8217;ve been training for the past two years. I&#8217;ve made some really good friends there and the head instructor is the best. Fortunately our new home has another BJJ gym under the same affiliation really close to it, so I&#8217;ll be training there after we move. I&#8217;ll definitely miss&nbsp; my training partners though üò≠.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the middle of November, Kylea and I attended a cooking class at <a href=\"https://www.ateliersetsaveurs.com/en/\">Ateliers et Saveurs</a> in the Old Port. We worked together with another group to make some delicious butter chicken along with some sides and dessert.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7125 lazy-load\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Kylea preparing the dessert.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our instructor was awesome and we were grouped with a fun and friendly bunch. I also learned some nice knife techniques which I started applying at home. I definitely recommend the cooking classes at Ateliers et Saveurs, whether it be for a team event at work or for a date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/butterchicken-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7140 lazy-load\" width=\"487\" height=\"648\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/butterchicken-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/butterchicken-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/butterchicken.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\" /><figcaption>The completed butter chicken meal.

I was introduced to it by my cousin Jun (he introduces me to a lot of cool stuff, such as Magic the Gathering, floating tanks, and more).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace-1024x577.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7097 lazy-load\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a>&nbsp;is a great guided meditation app.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I started my meditation journey using the <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> app, which I&#8217;ve been finding extremely helpful. My main goal with meditation was to get better at focusing at work and avoid being tempted by distractions. Frankly I haven&#8217;t had much success on this yet, but I&#8217;m not expecting immediate results. I&#8217;m just going to keep meditating on the daily and see where it takes me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m super curious to hear about what kind of impact meditation has had on others. If you&#8217;re into meditation, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What I read</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This month I read <em>Name of the Wind</em>, the first of a fantasy series by Patrick Rothfuss.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind-631x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7089 lazy-load\" width=\"397\" height=\"643\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind-631x1024.jpg 631w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind-185x300.jpg 185w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind-768x1246.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Name of the Wind</em>&nbsp;follows the story of Kvothe, a seemingly ordinary innkeeper with a mysterious and intriguing past. As Kvothe recounts his upbringing to a scribe known as Chronicler, we slowly discover that he is no ordinary man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really liked the universe that Rothfuss creates in the book, as it reminded me a lot of <em>The Witcher 3</em> video game (though far less violent). I was so enthralled with this book that I even put playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on hold (I&#8217;m still at the darn snow level!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only thing I didn&#8217;t like about <em>Name of the Wind</em>&nbsp;was how it ended with so many loose ends. I felt a little salty about this but I suppose the author succeeded in making me want to read the sequels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s all for this month. Time to start packin&#8217;! üì¶</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"november-2018-holy-frig-we-bought-a-house-edition"}}
