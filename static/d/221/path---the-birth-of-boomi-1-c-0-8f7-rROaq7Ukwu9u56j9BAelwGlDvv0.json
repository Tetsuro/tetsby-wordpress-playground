{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"The Birth of Boomi","content":"<p>You may be wondering, &#8220;what the hell is that Boombox thing on the top-right corner of your site?&#8221;. Allow me to introduce you to Boomi.</p>\n<p>The idea for Boomi spawned from a picture of a boom box that I saw on Flickr. The boom box kind of reminded me of a robot head, so I started doodling on my notepad. After a few sketches, I decided to use him for a music video project that I had to do for Audio/Video class back in 2007. His debut was in the following music video (WARNING: my animation skills are laughable).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ttUdiqKk3r8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ttUdiqKk3r8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>I was pretty satisfied with the music video, but I felt that I could further develop Boomi as a character. In summer 2008, I decided to make Boomi into a physical product, with the magic of papercraft. I felt that papercraft was the perfect medium to turn Boomi into a physical product because A) Boomi has a very &#8216;boxy&#8217; shape, which is ideal for papercraft, and B) papercraft is cheap. Another reason why I wanted to make Boomi into a physical was that I wanted to create my own &#8216;designer toy&#8217; &#8211; kind of like a poor man&#8217;s Munny doll ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/pic11-588x441.jpg\" alt=\"pic1\" title=\"pic1\" width=\"588\" height=\"441\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-646\" /></p>\n<p>I started off by drawing many sketches of what the new-and-improved Boomi might look like. I drew many different versions of Boomi in different angles and shapes, keeping in mind that I have to make him simple to make with paper. Unfortunately I seem to have lost almost all of my sketches &#8211; the scan above is one of the few I could find.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/pic21-588x441.jpg\" alt=\"pic2\" title=\"pic2\" width=\"588\" height=\"441\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-647\" /></p>\n<p>I then created blueprints for Boomi and started to build some prototype models. I experimented with different sizes, shapes, and proportions, until I was 100% satisfied. I used scrap paper for all prototypes in order to minimize the waste of paper. The trickiest part was coming up with a way to make the head. I learned that it&#8217;s not very easy to create a box with paper, because the paper is usually too flimsy to close off the final edge (I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s a little difficult to explain in words, but it&#8217;s actually pretty tricky building a box out of thin paper). </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/pic41-588x441.jpg\" alt=\"pic4\" title=\"pic4\" width=\"588\" height=\"441\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-648\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/pic3.jpg\" alt=\"pic3\" title=\"pic3\" width=\"453\" height=\"604\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-302\" srcset=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/pic3.jpg 453w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/pic3-225x300.jpg 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\" /></p>\n<p>Shown above are pictures of the version 1.0 release of Boomi. Although I am very satisfied with the look-and-feel of Boomi, I feel that I can still improve on the blueprint, and make him easier to build. In the upcoming weeks, I plan on creating improved and simpler blueprints for Boomi. </p>\n<p>Please click <a href=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Boomi-v.1.0.zip\">here</a> to download the blueprints for Boomi v.1.0.
