{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Shopify Tutorial: How to Create a Part Picker Form","content":"<p>\t\t\t\tIn this tutorial we&#8217;re going to be making a parts builder form. It&#8217;s an extension of the <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-tutorial-order-form/\">Order Form</a> that I created a while back. It works by listing single-option products in a table with each variant listed as a radio button. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://stroman-nolan491.myshopify.com/pages/order-form-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/parts-builder.png\" alt=\"parts builder\" width=\"1002\" height=\"577\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;\"/></a></p>\n<p>You can see a demo <a href=\"https://stroman-nolan491.myshopify.com/pages/order-form-2\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">1. Create a new linklist</h2>\n<p>The first thing you want to do is create a linklist that holds the products that you want to sell through the order form. Go to the &#8220;Navigation&#8221; page of your admin, and create a new linklist called &#8220;Part Picker&#8221;. Next, add links to the products that you want to have listed on the order form. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-link-list.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-link-list.png\" alt=\"part picker link list\" width=\"944\" height=\"490\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2628\" srcset=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-link-list.png 944w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-link-list-300x156.png 300w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-link-list-768x399.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 944px) 100vw, 944px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">The products that you enter in this linklist will be shown in the table that we&#8217;re going to create in the next step.</div>\n<p>Please keep in mind that you can only use <strong>single-option products</strong>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">2. Create an alternate page template</h2>\n<p>In your Template Editor, click &#8220;add a new template&#8221; under the Templates section. Select &#8220;page&#8221;, and call it &#8220;part-picker&#8221;.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template.png\" alt=\"part picker template\" width=\"896\" height=\"749\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2632\" srcset=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template.png 896w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template-300x251.png 300w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template-768x642.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Copy the code from this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/raw/4409175/27c1f5e2cfb26202ef79d434aaa68733969ed745/gistfile1.txt\">gist</a> and paste it in page.part-picker.liquid. Hit save. It&#8217;s pretty bare-bones, and there&#8217;s a bit of inline CSS so you&#8217;ll have to pretty it up a bit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">3. Create a new page for your part picker</h2>\n<p>Go to Blogs &#038; Pages, and create a new Page. You can title it whatever you wish. The important part here is to tell it to use the freshly-created page.part-picker.liquid template. You do this by selecting it under the &#8220;Templates&#8221; dropdown, shown below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template-page.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template-page.png\" alt=\"part picker template page\" width=\"986\" height=\"637\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2636\" srcset=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template-page.png 986w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template-page-300x194.png 300w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/part-picker-template-page-768x496.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px\" /></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">4. Add the part picker script</h2>\n<p>Inside your Template Editor, create a new snippet called &#8220;parts-picker-script&#8221;. Add the contents of <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/raw/4409215/794c304183a319111350b562dcf75cf66bfb4ccf/gistfile1.txt\">this gist</a> inside it. </p>\n<p>Place the following code right before the &lt;/body&gt; tag in theme.liquid.</p>\n<pre>\n<code>\n{% include 'parts-picker-script' %}\n</code>\n</pre>\n<h2 class=\"step\">The End</h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s it that&#8217;s all! You will likely need to sprinkle some CSS love on your table to make it fit in with your theme. \t\t</p>\n","wordpress_id":2585},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Hi,<br />\nI am trying to work out a way to add a table for my variants onto my product pages so customers can select multiple variants before adding branding and then hitting add to cart.<br />\nCan your table be added to a products page?</p>\n","author_name":"Kylie","date":"February 19th, 2017"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>I know this is a little dated but my price doesn&#8217;t change when you select a different variant.
