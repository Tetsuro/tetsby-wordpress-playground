Montreal Meets is an event organized by <a href=\"http://www.aoirostudio.com/\">Aoiro Studios</a> where several designers from around the world give talks on design and their experience as a designer. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>I went to Montreal Meets mostly for James White (aka <a href=\"http://blog.signalnoise.com/\">SignalNoise</a>). I first saw James at <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/fitc-toronto-2011/\">FITC 2011 in Toronto</a> and have been a big fan ever since. At Montreal Meets, James did a talk called &#8220;Design Renegade&#8221; in which he talked about doing creative projects on your time to keep yourself motivated and improve as a designer. </p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen James&#8217; talks, I highly recommend watching the video below. This one&#8217;s from FITC 2011 in Toronto, and it&#8217;s super-inspirational.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M9mV1rrZCQo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Another talk I really enjoyed was Fabio Sasso from Fabio Sasso <a href=\"http://abduzeedo.com/\">Abduzeedo</a>. He talked about the ups and downs of his career and his whole experience with creating Abduzeedo, a huge blog for design inspiration and tutorials. </p>\n<p>The other talks were awesome too, and all in all I had a great time at Montreal Meets. Definitely would like to go again next year! Montreal is a frikkin awesome city&#8230; I want to move there some day. </p>\n<p>THE END\t\t</p>\n","wordpress_id":2191},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"montreal-meets-two","wordpressId":2191,"newerPostSlug":"doodlage","olderPostSlug":"pop-theme"}}
