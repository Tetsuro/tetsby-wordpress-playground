Well, I do kind of do that on this blog: <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/category/tutorial/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.tetchi.ca/category/tutorial/</a>. Whenever I have a &#8220;oh snap, you can do that?&#8221; moment, I write about it here. Most of them involve a combination of Liquid and jQuery. For example:</p>\n<p>&#8211; <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-tutorial-captions-for-blog-article-and-pages/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-tutorial-captions-for-blog-article-and-pages/</a><br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-tutorial-limiting-storefront-search-to-certain-product-types/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-tutorial-limiting-storefront-search-to-certain-product-types/</a><br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-tutorial-how-to-create-a-part-picker-form/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.tetchi.ca/shopify-tutorial-how-to-create-a-part-picker-form/</a></p>\n<p>&#8230; to name a few. ðŸ™‚</p>\n","author_name":"tetchi","date":"April 10th, 2013"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>So to clarify, I hope, what I was saying on Twitter is that when I started using Liquid I thought of it more or less as a simple templating language. I knew from reviewing the Shopify Resources page that there was logic and variable capabilities built, but the way I tend to learn is by absorbing what I need in that moment for a specific task and I think all I was able to &#8220;see&#8221; was if/then statements and loops. Which I mean with your average theme you could get away with using just that.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve since come to realize after looking through some themes that you can do things with Liquid that you might otherwise rely on javascript or to accomplish. </p>\n<p>SO, getting to the point, what I&#8217;d like to see for a tutorial would be more &#8220;cool&#8221; real work examples of using Liquids logic and variables. Maybe even a short one off of something that made you go, &#8220;Awesome! I didn&#8217;t know I could do that with Liquid.&#8221; I&#8217;ve had that experience myself, more than once.</p>\n","author_name":"Paul","date":"April 10th, 2013"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>Hey Paul, AFAIK it doesn&#8217;t affect load times all that much.
