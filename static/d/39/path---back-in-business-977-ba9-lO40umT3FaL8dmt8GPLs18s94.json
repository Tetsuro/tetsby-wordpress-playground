I will also try my best to catch up on unanswered comments! It&#x2019;s starting to sink in that there are only two more semesters of school left&#x2026; I can&#x2019;t wait to finish completely!</p>\n<p>The highlight of this past semester was diving into the world of interactive multimedia. For one of our classes, we were taught an open-source programming language called Processing. My classmates Grant Lucas, Mark Pintar and I built the &#x2018;faceTable&#x2019;, which was an interactive table display that would display the user&#x2019;s Facebook information by using customized <a href=\"http://reactivision.sourceforge.net/\" title=\"Reactivision\">Reactivision</a> markers. Words don&#x2019;t do it justice &#x2013; we will be posting videos of it in action on Vimeo once we make the demonstration videos. </p>\n<h2 class=\"steps\">Plans for the summer</h2>\n<p>This summer I&#x2019;d like to find and share more hacks and tweaks in Shopify that would allow storeowners to add unique features to their store. I&#x2019;d also like to write more tutorials to help storeowners get started with their stores. </p>\n<p>In my spare time, I plan on playing around with Processing and OpenFrameworks in an attempt to create some cool visual displays. Particle systems is an example of something I&#x2019;d like to create using one of these two languages. I&#x2019;ll also be playing shows with the band The Mudplots, as well as work on another band project that I have brewing &#x1F642;</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#x2019;m off to kill some more time &#x2013; two more hours until my flight to Toronto! Don&#x2019;t fail me, Reddit&#x2026;</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A random elderly man from Calgary just approached me with a super-serious look on his face asking if I could check something for him using the wifi on my laptop. Thinking it was an emergency, I opened up my laptop. Turns out he just really needed to know the result of the Pittsburgh vs Montreal game for his hockey pool. Canadians are awesome &#x1F600;</p>\n</body></html>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"back-in-business"}}
