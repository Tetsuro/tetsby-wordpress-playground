{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Happy Thanksgiving!","content":"<p>Happy Thanksgiving to all my Canadian peoples! I hope you guys are having an awesome long weekend so far.</p>\n<p>I apologize for the lack of updates recently, I&#8217;ve been extremely busy with client projects, side projects, and moving. I do have a few Shopify tutorial ideas floating around in my mind, but I haven&#8217;t had much time to sit down and write them out. I&#8217;m hoping that in the coming weeks things will start to slow down.</p>\n<p>So a couple of weeks ago, a bunch of my friends at Carleton University got together and started a student club called CUJA (Carleton University Japanese Association). I was appointed to be the web master and graphic designer, so I&#8217;ve been working on their branding, their website, and their membership cards. I&#8217;m still working on the mock-up of the site, shown below (a big, big thank you to my chums Mark Dunkley and Daniel Weinand for their tips and advices!).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3.jpg\"><img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"cuja_mockup3\" title=\"cuja_mockup3\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-570 lazy-load\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3-1024x625.jpg 1024w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3-491x300.jpg 491w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3.jpg 1516w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Just yesterday one of the CUJA execs and I went to Staples to order the membership cards that I had designed. They won&#8217;t be ready for another 4-5 days, but I can&#8217;t wait to see how they turn out! </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards.png\"><img data-src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards-300x225.png\" alt=\"cards\" title=\"cards\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-577 lazy-load\" data-srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards-300x225.png 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards-400x300.png 400w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another thing that was keeping me busy was moving. A couple of weeks ago I had moved from my former apartment to my parent&#8217;s place so that I can live with them until the new apartment becomes available. It&#8217;s my first time living at home in two years, so it was definitely a heart-warming experience (free food is also a huge plus!). I&#8217;ll be moving to the new place in about a week, and once I settle in I&#8217;ll be working more on the Shopify tutorials.</p>\n<p>Well that&#8217;s enough rambling for today! Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"happy-thanksgiving"}}
