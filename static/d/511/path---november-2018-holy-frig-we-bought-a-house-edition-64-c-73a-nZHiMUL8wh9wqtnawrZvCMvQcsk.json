{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"November 2018: Holy Frig We Bought a House Edition","content":"<!--more--><html><head></head><body><h2>Stuff that happened</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday October 31st, Kylea and I finalized the purchase of our first ever home. We&#x2019;d been looking since May and we were ecstatic to finally settle on one &#x1F601;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say I was nervous as hell. It was by far the biggest purchase I&#x2019;d ever made, and I couldn&#x2019;t help doubting my decision and asking myself questions like &#x201C;is this really worth it? What sort of things could go wrong? What if Hurricane Neddy swoops down and wrecks the house?&#x201D;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These doubts were soon squashed with the excitement of having a place to call our own. Adios, neighbours who walk way too fucking loud!&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#x2019;t move in until late December so we&#x2019;ve got some time to prepare. I&#x2019;m going to miss living in the Mile End; most of all, I&#x2019;ll miss the Brazilian jiu jitsu (BJJ) gym where I&#x2019;ve been training for the past two years. I&#x2019;ve made some really good friends there and the head instructor is the best. Fortunately our new home has another BJJ gym under the same affiliation really close to it, so I&#x2019;ll be training there after we move. I&#x2019;ll definitely miss&#xA0; my training partners though &#x1F62D;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the middle of November, Kylea and I attended a cooking class at <a href=\"https://www.ateliersetsaveurs.com/en/\">Ateliers et Saveurs</a> in the Old Port. We worked together with another group to make some delicious butter chicken along with some sides and dessert.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597-1024x768.jpg\" alt class=\"wp-image-7125\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_3597.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption>Kylea preparing the dessert.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our instructor was awesome and we were grouped with a fun and friendly bunch. I also learned some nice knife techniques which I started applying at home. I definitely recommend the cooking classes at Ateliers et Saveurs, whether it be for a team event at work or for a date.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/butterchicken-768x1024.jpg\" alt class=\"wp-image-7140\" width=\"487\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/butterchicken-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/butterchicken-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/butterchicken.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px\"><figcaption>The completed butter chicken meal. Noms &#x1F924;</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>November also marked the second month of my journey into meditation. I was introduced to it by my cousin Jun (he introduces me to a lot of cool stuff, such as Magic the Gathering, floating tanks, and more).&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace-1024x577.jpg\" alt class=\"wp-image-7097\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace-768x433.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/headspace.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a>&#xA0;is a great guided meditation app.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I started my meditation journey using the <a href=\"https://www.headspace.com/\">Headspace</a> app, which I&#x2019;ve been finding extremely helpful. My main goal with meditation was to get better at focusing at work and avoid being tempted by distractions. Frankly I haven&#x2019;t had much success on this yet, but I&#x2019;m not expecting immediate results. I&#x2019;m just going to keep meditating on the daily and see where it takes me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m super curious to hear about what kind of impact meditation has had on others. If you&#x2019;re into meditation, I&#x2019;d love to hear your thoughts!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What I read</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This month I read <em>Name of the Wind</em>, the first of a fantasy series by Patrick Rothfuss.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind-631x1024.jpg\" alt class=\"wp-image-7089\" width=\"397\" height=\"643\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind-631x1024.jpg 631w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind-185x300.jpg 185w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind-768x1246.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/name-of-the-wind.jpg 1350w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 397px) 100vw, 397px\"></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Name of the Wind</em>&#xA0;follows the story of Kvothe, a seemingly ordinary innkeeper with a mysterious and intriguing past. As Kvothe recounts his upbringing to a scribe known as Chronicler, we slowly discover that he is no ordinary man.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really liked the universe that Rothfuss creates in the book, as it reminded me a lot of <em>The Witcher 3</em> video game (though far less violent). I was so enthralled with this book that I even put playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on hold (I&#x2019;m still at the darn snow level!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only thing I didn&#x2019;t like about <em>Name of the Wind</em>&#xA0;was how it ended with so many loose ends. I felt a little salty about this but I suppose the author succeeded in making me want to read the sequels.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p>That&#x2019;s all for this month.
