{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"BeatsX are shit","content":"<!--more--><html><head></head><body><p>I don&#x2019;t usually write about products but I&#x2019;m so fed up with the BeatsX earphones that I need to tell others about it. In the one and a half years that I&#x2019;ve owned them, they&#x2019;ve broken&#xA0;<strong>three times</strong>&#xFEFF;. Luckily I haven&#x2019;t had to pay for a single repair, but the process of exchanging it is starting to become time consuming and really annoying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I purchased my BeatsX back in February 2017. I fell in love with them right away; the wirelessness meant I didn&#x2019;t have to deal with tangling cords, and because they were in-ear I could listen to podcasts even on loud commutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little did I know how fragile they were. Let me tell you about my BeatsX woes&#x2026;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Incident #1: November 2017</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time my BeatsX broke was when I was in Japan. All of a sudden it stopped connecting to any of my devices. I later found out that this was a common issue, as I saw multiple threads on Reddit and Apple Support forum posts about it. On this same trip both my iPhone (camera stopped working) and Macbook (battery stopped charging) had broken so I was already pretty pissed off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I couldn&#x2019;t take them for repairs anywhere in Naha so I had to wait until I got home to Montreal before I could do anything. I also refused to buy one of those overpriced 3.5mm-to-Lightning adapters. All of this made for an extremely boring plane ride back to Montreal.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image border--gray\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-1.png\" alt class=\"wp-image-6759\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-1.png 1516w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-1-300x272.png 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-1-768x696.png 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-1-1024x928.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1516px) 100vw, 1516px\"></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Incident #2: March 2018</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Several months had gone by and I had almost forgotten about the first incident, when suddenly the right earbud started to crackle. Shortly after the right earbud stopped working entirely, and I had to make yet another trip to the Apple Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image border--gray\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-2.png\" alt class=\"wp-image-6760\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-2.png 1508w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-2-300x266.png 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-2-768x680.png 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/work-authorization-2-1024x907.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1508px) 100vw, 1508px\"></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, the Apple staff replaced my headphones free of charge because I&#x2019;d just gotten them replaced in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Incident #3: July 2018</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The third incident happened again while I was traveling, this time in Toronto. Once again, the right earbud started crackling and lost output.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repair-status.png\" alt class=\"wp-image-6785\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repair-status.png 857w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repair-status-300x131.png 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/repair-status-768x335.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I called Apple support and luckily the Apple support staff was super understanding. He offered to send me a new pair even though mine were out of warranty by a long shot. The silver lining in all of this is that Apple&#x2019;s support is awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m so disappointed with the quality of the BeatsX. They are awesome when they work but it really sucks having to get them replaced so often. For ~$200 CAD I shouldn&#x2019;t have to worry about them breaking all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#x2019;re considering buying a pair of BeatsX earphones, I&#x2019;d think twice. They are fragile as hell and break even with regular use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Update: October 11, 2018</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Welp. The replacement that I got in July just broke. The left channel stopped working. I called Apple Support and they said it&#x2019;ll be $79 to replace.&#xA0;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point I&#x2019;m done with these pieces of shit. If anybody has recommendations for good wireless headphones, please let me know.</p>\n\t\t</body></html>","wordpress_id":6751},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"beatsx-are-shit","wordpressId":6751,"newerPostSlug":"august-2018-big-30-in-nyc-edition","olderPostSlug":"july-2018-its-too-friggin-hot-edition"}}
