He introduced himself as Hiroshi, along with his wife Kyoko.</p>\n<p>Hiroshi and Kyoko were from Chiba (near Tokyo), and like myself were first-time visitors to Hakodate. They were both in their 70s and full of energy.</p>\n<p>We ended up talking for hours about our past travels, exchanged tips about what to do in Hakodate, differences between Canadian and Japanese culture, etc. Hiroshi graciously ensured that my <em>ochoco</em> (cup for drinking sake) was always full throughout the entire night &#x1F376;.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/new-friends.jpg\" alt=\"new friends!\"></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">My new friends Kyoko-san and Hiroshi-san</div>\n<p>I genuinely loved chatting with Hiroshi and Kyoko and listening to their life story. Travelling alone has its benefits but can be a little lonely at times. Sometimes you just want someone to talk to face-to-face and have good laughs with. After traveling alone for a few days I was feeling quite exhausted, but I felt completely recharged after that night.</p>\n<p>Before we parted ways I asked if I could have their address so that we could keep in touch. They were more than happy to share, and we&#x2019;ve been writing letters to each other ever since. I get so excited whenever I receive a letter from them; there&#x2019;s just something more personal about handwritten snail mail.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/letter.jpg\" alt=\"one of many letters from Kyoko and Hiroshi\"></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">One of many letters from Kyoko &amp; Hiroshi, this one in adorable Totoro puzzle form.</div>\n<p>I went into that bar for a quick bite but ended up forging a friendship with two really cool people. You never know what kind of interesting people you can meet through random encounters.</p>\n</body></html>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"an-unexpected-friendship"}}
