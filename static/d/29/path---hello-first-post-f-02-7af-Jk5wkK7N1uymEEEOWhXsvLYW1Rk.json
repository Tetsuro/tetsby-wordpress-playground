First Post!","content":"<p>\t\t\t\tHi everyone, thanks for visiting my blog! </p>\n<p>I know I know, it&#8217;s looking rather empty in here right now, but starting this month, I&#8217;ll be writing about web design, music, art&#8230; pretty much anything that I think is awesome. </p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll also be writing a lot about Shopify. I plan on writing a lot of tips &#038; tutorials on using Shopify&#8217;s Liquid templating system. I think Shopify is the best e-commerce solution out there, and my goal is to help more people get started with their Shopify stores. </p>\n<p>By no means am I a web design or e-commerce expert. However, I think I have enough knowledge on both of these topics to help those who might be a little nervous to start out on their own. With that said, if you see something in my code that you think can be improved, please feel free to notify me. I enjoy learning as much as I enjoy teaching!</p>\n<p>Thanks again for dropping by &#8211; don&#8217;t forget to check back!</p>\n"},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>John &#038; Mark: Oh grow up, guys!</p>\n<p>Amanda: Thanks Amanda!
