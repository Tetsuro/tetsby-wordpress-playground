{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Happy Thanksgiving!","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>Happy Thanksgiving to all my Canadian peoples! I hope you guys are having an awesome long weekend so far.</p>\n<p>I apologize for the lack of updates recently, I&#x2019;ve been extremely busy with client projects, side projects, and moving. I do have a few Shopify tutorial ideas floating around in my mind, but I haven&#x2019;t had much time to sit down and write them out. I&#x2019;m hoping that in the coming weeks things will start to slow down.</p>\n<p>So a couple of weeks ago, a bunch of my friends at Carleton University got together and started a student club called CUJA (Carleton University Japanese Association). I was appointed to be the web master and graphic designer, so I&#x2019;ve been working on their branding, their website, and their membership cards. I&#x2019;m still working on the mock-up of the site, shown below (a big, big thank you to my chums Mark Dunkley and Daniel Weinand for their tips and advices!).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3-300x183.jpg\" alt=\"cuja_mockup3\" title=\"cuja_mockup3\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-570\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3-300x183.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3-1024x625.jpg 1024w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cuja_mockup3.jpg 1516w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p>\n<p>Just yesterday one of the CUJA execs and I went to Staples to order the membership cards that I had designed. They won&#x2019;t be ready for another 4-5 days, but I can&#x2019;t wait to see how they turn out! </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards.png\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards-300x225.png\" alt=\"cards\" title=\"cards\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-577\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards-300x225.png 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards-768x576.png 768w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards.png 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></a></p>\n<p>Another thing that was keeping me busy was moving. A couple of weeks ago I had moved from my former apartment to my parent&#x2019;s place so that I can live with them until the new apartment becomes available. It&#x2019;s my first time living at home in two years, so it was definitely a heart-warming experience (free food is also a huge plus!). I&#x2019;ll be moving to the new place in about a week, and once I settle in I&#x2019;ll be working more on the Shopify tutorials.</p>\n<p>Well that&#x2019;s enough rambling for today! Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>\n</body></html>","wordpress_id":563},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Thank you Caroline! ðŸ™‚</p>\n","author_name":"admin","date":"October 21st, 2009"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>This card looks great!</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re a pro, Tetsu!</p>\n","author_name":"Caroline Schnapp","date":"October 19th, 2009"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>Thanks guys!</p>\n","author_name":"admin","date":"October 15th, 2009"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>Hey Tets, awesome work.
