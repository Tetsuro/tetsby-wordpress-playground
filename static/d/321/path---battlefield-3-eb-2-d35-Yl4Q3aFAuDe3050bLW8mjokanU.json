{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Battlefield 3","content":"<p>For the past couple of months I&#8217;ve been hooked on DICE&#8217;s latest game, Battlefield 3 (BF3). I was a huge fan of Battlefield 1942 so I knew that I would love BF3 right off the bat. </p>\n<p>BF3 is the <strong>best FPS I&#8217;ve ever played</strong>. Between BF1942 and BF3, I played a lot of FPS games but most of them were short-lived. One exception is TF2, which I played a lot until it went crazy with all the hats, crafting and micro-transactions.</p>\n<p>One of BF3&#8217;s great new features is &#8220;Battlelog&#8221;, which is EA&#8217;s social platform for BF3 players. The best part about Battlelog is its stat-tracking. Through Battlelog you can check your kill:death ratio, weapon stats, unlocks, awards, and reports of past rounds. I find myself logging into Battlelog after rounds to see how I did, and whether or not I&#8217;m about to unlock something. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tetchi_bf3_stats-e1325197150463.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tetchi_bf3_stats-e1325197150463.png\" alt=\"my bf3 stats\" title=\"my bf3 stats\" width=\"500\" height=\"460\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1964\" srcset=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tetchi_bf3_stats-e1325197150463.png 500w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/tetchi_bf3_stats-e1325197150463-300x276.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Battlelog provides you with lots of sweet stats</div>\n<p>As for the actual gameplay, what makes BF3 so awesome is its emphasis on teamwork. This was made even more true when I was one day recruited by a platoon called <a href=\"http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655391303178979/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"N7 Spectres platoon page\">N7 Spectres</a>. I was asked to join when I was having a pretty sweet game on Noshahr Canals. I was a little worried at first because I thought that being in a platoon meant daily practices and getting super-pissed at one another for messing up, but man, how wrong I was. N7 Spectres is a group of some of the coolest, friendliest and most importantly skilled players, and it makes playing BF3 even more fun.</p>\n<p>N7 Spectre&#8217;s founder, eGessDub, posts some pretty sweet gameplay videos on his Youtube channel <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/EssDubGaming?blend=1&#038;ob=video-mustangbase\" title=\"essDubgaming youtube\">here</a>. Yesterday eGessDub posted a game with me in it! It&#8217;s pretty rad to re-experience the match from another person&#8217;s perspective. </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/TPG9ykEBjSQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">eGessDub&#8217;s latest replay video. Tearin&#8217; it up on Seine Crossing!</div>\n<p><!--more--><br />\nKnifing people in BF3 is seriously a metagame, and it&#8217;s one of my favourite aspects of the game. When you perform a knife attack from behind an enemy, you go into this wicked animation where you grab your enemy&#8217;s dog tag and stab him in the heart/throat. Knifing can be pretty difficult though, as it makes you vulnerable to nearby enemies, and the knife animation doesn&#8217;t kick in all the time (it&#8217;s a little buggy IMO). This makes performing a knife kill all the more satisfying. </p>\n<p>This has developed into an unhealthy addiction for me, as I&#8217;ll go out of my way to run behind an enemy and snatch his dog tag. Within Battlelog, there&#8217;s a section to see all of the stolen dog tags, and it has become my very own <a href=\"http://images.wikia.com/avp/images/f/f8/Trophywall-1-.jpg\">trophy room</a> like in  the movie <em>Predators</em>. The other week I lucked out and <a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dog-tags.png\" title=\"DICE dog tag\"> stole a dog tag from a DICE developer.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/jafjX.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jafjX.jpg\" alt=\"Knifing an unsuspecting enemy from behind\"/></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">A screencap of the knifing animation. Image found on /r/battlefield3</div>\n<p>If you play Battlefield 3, you can find me on Battlelog <a href=\"http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/user/tetchi/\">here</a>. Hit me up if you want to play some rounds :). If you don&#8217;t have BF3 yet, go get it NOW!!</p>\n"},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Thanks for reading buddy!

It&#8217;s not completely open per se, but Autodesk provides a comprehensive SDK that one can use to export/import FBX.<br />\nIf Autodesk allowed exporting all the features present in Maya (like all deformers), they&#8217;d also have to supply the proprietary code that applies all the deformations. Not necessarily open source it, but at least supply it with the SDK. And while most of that code is trivial , some of it may have some trade secrets (however ridiculously outdated).<br />\nEven if that wasn&#8217;t an issue, it&#8217;d still be a huge amount of work to essentially embed all the features of .ma/mb file into fbx.<br />\nEven if they decided to do that, what do you do with custom nodes?

This means adoption would suffer and FBX wouldn&#8217;t be supported completely by anyone (because to support it would require a lot more effort, essentially as much as supporting loading a full Maya scene). Even worse, if adoption wasn&#8217;t an issue (like if Autodesk decided to extend FBX with a bunch of features to support more precise export from Maya scenes), it&#8217;d only mean that a lot of software that supports FBX fully now simply wouldn&#8217;t support those features.
