I wanted to revisit my dog dude because looking at it now, it looks way too &#x201C;plain&#x201D;. I think the problem is that there&#x2019;s not enough detail. </p>\n<p>I started sketching again and decided to give him a nice shag. I also wanted to add more details around the eyes and mouth so that they don&#x2019;t look like they&#x2019;re floating there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scan.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scan-843x1024.jpg\" style=\"width:400px; height:auto;\" alt title=\"Scan\"></a></p>\n<p>I didn&#x2019;t like how sharp his hair was, so I decided to restart and give him a bit more bounce (don&#x2019;t know if that&#x2019;s the right term, heh).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scan2.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scan2-791x1024.jpg\" alt title=\"Scan2\" style=\"width:400px; height:auto;\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2216\"></a><br>\n<!--more--><br>\nOnce I was happy, I scanned the sketch, pulled it up in Photoshop, and flipped him horizontally along the axis that I drew. This gave me a better idea of what the drawing would look like once the other side is complete. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dog_joined.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dog_joined.jpg\" alt title=\"dog_joined\" width=\"500\" height=\"647\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2213\"></a></p>\n<p>Now back to tracing. At this stage I&#x2019;m going to start making variations on the left side so that he doesn&#x2019;t look completely symmetrical. For example I&#x2019;m thinking of having his left ear folded, as well as having variations in his hair. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo.jpeg\" alt title=\"photo\" width=\"434\" height=\"524\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2214\"></a></p>\n<p>Can&#x2019;t wait to start vectorizing! I wish I could keep drawing but I can&#x2019;t find my friggin pencil sharpener and I&#x2019;m really pissed off &gt;:(</p>\n</body></html>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"doodlage"}}
