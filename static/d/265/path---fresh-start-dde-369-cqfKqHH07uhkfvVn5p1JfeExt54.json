{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Fresh Start","content":"<p>\t\t\t\tMan, it&#8217;s been a while since I last posted! Time flies! </p>\n<p>July was really shitty to be honest. I done broke up with the special lady, so that kept my mind occupied for a while. You know how it is, when you break up you pretty much lose motivation to do anything hahaâ€¦ though I&#8217;ve been feeling much better lately. I usually don&#8217;t write about this kinda stuff hereâ€¦ but it&#8217;s my blog, so <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UnhiA_6q9MY/T4M0WupVcrI/AAAAAAAABMo/pAyZkCY59vU/s1600/cartman-i-do-what-i-want.jpg\">whatevuh I do what I want</a>! </p>\n<p>So yeah, I&#8217;ve started up some new projects to keep me busy. One of the things that really got my juices flowin&#8217; was the launch of the Merchify app. Merchify is this new Shopify app that lets you print and sell t-shirts, mugs, and posters on-demand, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about any leftovers. The plan is to start up my own Shopify store and sell some t-shirt designs with my doodles ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.merchify.com\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/merchifymainheader.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"merchifymainheader\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2372\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;\" srcset=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/merchifymainheader.png 724w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/merchifymainheader-300x43.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Check out Merchify! It&#8217;s fucking sick!</div>\n<p>Another thing I want to work on is tutorials on Shopify&#8217;s new line item properties feature. This feature is seriously huge! It opens up a lot of opportunities in Shopify, and makes it that much more powerful. You can read more about line item properties in the Wiki <a href=\"http://wiki.shopify.com/Line_Item_Properties\">here</a>. You can see a demo <a href=\"http://grady-oreilly-and-boehm1138.myshopify.com/products/customize-me\">here</a>. I&#8217;m thinking tutorials on how to implement a colour picker to a product page, or even color swatches&#8230; the possibilities are endless! </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://grady-oreilly-and-boehm1138.myshopify.com/products/customize-me\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/line-item-properties.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"line item properties\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2375\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;\" srcset=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/line-item-properties.png 930w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/line-item-properties-300x228.png 300w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/line-item-properties-768x585.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 930px) 100vw, 930px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Finally, starting to get back into playing live music again. The band that I started last year, <a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/move-your-mountain/\">Move Your Mountain</a>, is unfortunately on hiatus until next April, but I&#8217;m going to be hitting up open jams around the city. Local jazz singer <a href=\"http://www.reneeyoxon.com/\">RenÃ©e Yoxon</a> runs jazz jam sessions at Pressed, so I&#8217;m going to be attending that on the 18th. I&#8217;m also going to be hitting up the open blues jams at <a href=\"http://www.therainbow.ca/\">The Rainbow</a>, pretty stoked for that too!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.reneeyoxon.com/2012/04/29/saturday-afternoon-jazz-jam-at-pressed/\"><img src=\"http://www.reneeyoxon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/pressedposter2.gif\" style=\"width:500px; height: auto;\"/></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Come check it out!</div>\n<p>Gonna wrap this post up with a song that I discovered through my friend and coworker Dan Eveleigh, who runs this wicked blog called <a href=\"http://my-life-in-tunes.tumblr.com/\">My Life in Tunes</a>. The tune is called &#8220;Getaway&#8221; by Dr. John, and it&#8217;s basically my theme song right now, hahaha ðŸ˜€ </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4rcjXnuL2h4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\t\t</p>\n","wordpress_id":2359},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"fresh-start","wordpressId":2359,"previousPostSlug":"jammin","nextPostSlug":"t-and-c-tutorial-update"}}
