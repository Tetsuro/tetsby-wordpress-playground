{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Happy Thanksgiving!","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>Happy Thanksgiving to all my Canadian peoples! I hope you guys are having an awesome long weekend so far.</p>\n<p>I apologize for the lack of updates recently, I&#x2019;ve been extremely busy with client projects, side projects, and moving. I do have a few Shopify tutorial ideas floating around in my mind, but I haven&#x2019;t had much time to sit down and write them out. I&#x2019;m hoping that in the coming weeks things will start to slow down.</p>\n<p>So a couple of weeks ago, a bunch of my friends at Carleton University got together and started a student club called CUJA (Carleton University Japanese Association). I was appointed to be the web master and graphic designer, so I&#x2019;ve been working on their branding, their website, and their membership cards. I&#x2019;m still working on the mock-up of the site, shown below (a big, big thank you to my chums Mark Dunkley and Daniel Weinand for their tips and advices!).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"/static/893e7372518af8919eecba12a8b5be4d/e37ed/cuja_mockup3.jpg\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 61.08179419525066%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image aligncenter size-medium wp-image-570\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"cuja_mockup3\" title=\"cuja_mockup3\" src=\"/static/893e7372518af8919eecba12a8b5be4d/a111b/cuja_mockup3.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/893e7372518af8919eecba12a8b5be4d/aca85/cuja_mockup3.jpg 163w,\n/static/893e7372518af8919eecba12a8b5be4d/0954f/cuja_mockup3.jpg 325w,\n/static/893e7372518af8919eecba12a8b5be4d/a111b/cuja_mockup3.jpg 650w,\n/static/893e7372518af8919eecba12a8b5be4d/ce471/cuja_mockup3.jpg 975w,\n/static/893e7372518af8919eecba12a8b5be4d/bee4e/cuja_mockup3.jpg 1300w,\n/static/893e7372518af8919eecba12a8b5be4d/e37ed/cuja_mockup3.jpg 1516w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\">\n  </span></a></p>\n<p>Just yesterday one of the CUJA execs and I went to Staples to order the membership cards that I had designed. They won&#x2019;t be ready for another 4-5 days, but I can&#x2019;t wait to see how they turn out! </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards.png\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cards-300x225.png\" alt=\"cards\" title=\"cards\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-577\"></a></p>\n<p>Another thing that was keeping me busy was moving. A couple of weeks ago I had moved from my former apartment to my parent&#x2019;s place so that I can live with them until the new apartment becomes available. It&#x2019;s my first time living at home in two years, so it was definitely a heart-warming experience (free food is also a huge plus!). I&#x2019;ll be moving to the new place in about a week, and once I settle in I&#x2019;ll be working more on the Shopify tutorials.</p>\n<p>Well that&#x2019;s enough rambling for today! Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>\n</body></html>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"happy-thanksgiving"}}
