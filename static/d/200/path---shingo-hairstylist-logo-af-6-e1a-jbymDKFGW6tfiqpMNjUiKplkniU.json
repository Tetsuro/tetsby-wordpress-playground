{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Shingo Hairstylist logo","content":"<p>This past week I worked on a logo for a good friend of mine, Shingo. Shingo is a hairstylist from Japan, and he&#8217;s here in Ottawa to study english. He asked me to design a logo for him so that he could make business cards later down the road.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/shingo.png\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/shingo.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"shingo\" width=\"771\" height=\"356\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2011\" style=\"border:1px solid #eee;\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Shingo Fukuda, hairstylist.</div>\n<p>One thing that I learned from this exercise is that scissors are <strong>really</strong> freaking hard to draw. I must have drawn scissors dozens of times before getting it right. I would often screw up the proportion ratio between the blade and the ring, and the scissors would end up looking phallic (as silly as that sounds, haha). </p>\n<p>A book that I picked up last week called <a href=\"http://www.vonglitschka.com/2010/12/24/vector-basic-training-book/\" title=\"Vector Basic Training website\" target=\"_blank\">Vector Basic Training: A Systematic Creative Process for Building Precision Vector Artork</a> helped me a lot with my workflow. I&#8217;m not finished reading it but I took some tips from it as I worked on Shingo&#8217;s logo. In particular, Von Glitschka&#8217;s advice on going back-and-forth between analog and digital (i.e. from pencil on paper to the pen tool in Illustrator, and vice versa). I&#8217;m planning on writing a full review of the book later on, but it&#8217;s definitely pretty awesome so far. </p>\n<p>What are your thoughts on the logo? Any feedback/criticism would be awesome ðŸ™‚</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"a997f5b8-1def-5637-bba2-5aa7d7ab2f7c"}}
