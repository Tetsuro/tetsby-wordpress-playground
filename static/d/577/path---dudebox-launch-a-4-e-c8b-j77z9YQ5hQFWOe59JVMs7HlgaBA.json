{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Dudebox Launch!","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>Yesterday, a site that I really admire called <a href=\"http://www.dudebox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dudebox</a> made their launch. I first found about Dudebox when their web developer contacted me regarding the <a href=\"http://themes.shopify.com/themes/hipster/styles/grid\">Hipster theme</a>, which they are using for their site. </p>\n<p>Dudebox, as they put in their own words, &#x201C;is a team of fanatics on a mission.&#x201D; On their blog, they feature really talented artists from around the world and showcase some of the coolest vinyl toys I&#x2019;ve ever seen. They also hold cool <a href=\"http://www.dudebox.com/pages/competition\">competitions</a> for designers and artists.</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.dudebox.com\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dudebox.png\" alt title=\"dudebox\" width=\"970\" height=\"871\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1920\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dudebox.png 970w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dudebox-300x269.png 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dudebox-768x690.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px\"></a>\n</p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Dudebox.com, using the Hipster theme for Shopify.</div>\n<p>I gotta say, it&#x2019;s the best implementation of Hipster I&#x2019;ve seen so far. It&#x2019;s also exactly the kind of niche market that I was hoping Hipster would be used for.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s super-cool to see my theme being used as a showcase of amazing artists, and by a group of really cool individuals. Best of luck Dudebox, and looking forward to your shop launch in 2012!</p>\n</body></html>","wordpress_id":1918},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"dudebox-launch","wordpressId":1918,"newerPostSlug":"battlefield-3","olderPostSlug":"vectortuts-peer-review-part"}}
