{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"New Design (Now with Responsive Goodness!)","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>A few months ago I stumbled across this awesome book called <a href=\"http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design\">Responsive Web Design</a>. No lies, this book seriously changed my life. It changed the way I looked at websites, and I was absolutely fascinated by the way media queries and responsive web sites work. I found myself looking at responsive websites and resizing the browser window for hours on end seeing how the site adjusted to the viewport size.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/responsive.jpg\" alt=\"Ethan Marcotte&apos;s Responsive Web Design\" title=\"Responsive Web Design\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1811\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/responsive.jpg 500w, https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/responsive-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Are you remotely interested in web design? Do you like smartphones? FUCKING BUY THIS BOOK.</div>\n<p>That&#x2019;s why I spent the last month or so working on a responsive web site that I could call my own. At the same time I decided to &#x2018;re-brand&#x2019; my site to &#x201C;tetchi&#x201D; (my nickname since I was a kid) because it sounds way more wicked than &#x201C;tetsutakara&#x201D;. Today, I&#x2019;m releasing my responsive web site out in the wild!</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m currently working on a boilerplate for Shopify, which is based off of the excellent <a href=\"http://html5boilerplate.com/\" title=\"HTML 5 Boilerplate\">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>. The goal is to make it easier for Shopify theme authors to start building a theme from scratch. I then plan on building a super-basic theme with it and an up-to-date &#x201C;How to build a theme from scratch&#x201D; screencast for it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, hope my first responsive website works as it should. Please leave a comment if it looks funky on your device!</p>\n<p><strong>PS:</strong> I may have lost some recent comments as I transitioned to this new site&#x2026; sorry! Please leave another comment and I&#x2019;ll try to get back to you.</p>\n</body></html>","wordpress_id":1806},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Beginners should get a copy of this book 🙂</p>\n","author_name":"MobiMonster","date":"August 15th, 2012"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>Nice Kitt!
