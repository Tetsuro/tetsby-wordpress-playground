I wanted to revisit my dog dude because looking at it now, it looks way too &#8220;plain&#8221;. I think the problem is that there&#8217;s not enough detail. </p>\n<p>I started sketching again and decided to give him a nice shag. I also wanted to add more details around the eyes and mouth so that they don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re floating there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scan.jpeg\" ><img src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scan-843x1024.jpg\" style=\"width:400px; height:auto;\" alt=\"\" title=\"Scan\" /></a></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t like how sharp his hair was, so I decided to restart and give him a bit more bounce (don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the right term, heh).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scan2.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scan2-791x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Scan2\" style=\"width:400px; height:auto;\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2216\" /></a><br />\n<!--more--><br />\nOnce I was happy, I scanned the sketch, pulled it up in Photoshop, and flipped him horizontally along the axis that I drew. This gave me a better idea of what the drawing would look like once the other side is complete. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dog_joined.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/dog_joined.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"dog_joined\" width=\"500\" height=\"647\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2213\" /></a></p>\n<p>Now back to tracing. At this stage I&#8217;m going to start making variations on the left side so that he doesn&#8217;t look completely symmetrical. For example I&#8217;m thinking of having his left ear folded, as well as having variations in his hair. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/photo.jpeg\" alt=\"\" title=\"photo\" width=\"434\" height=\"524\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2214\" /></a></p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t wait to start vectorizing! I wish I could keep drawing but I can&#8217;t find my friggin pencil sharpener and I&#8217;m really pissed off >:(</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"doodlage"}}
