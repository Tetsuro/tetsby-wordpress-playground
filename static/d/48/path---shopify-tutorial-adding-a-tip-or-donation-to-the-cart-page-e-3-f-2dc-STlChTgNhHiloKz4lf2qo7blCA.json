{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Shopify Tutorial: Adding a Tip or Donation to the Cart page","content":"<p>\t\t\t\tThis is a quick tutorial to show you how to add a field for donations on your cart page. It works by adding a product worth $0.01 multiple times via AJAX. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://schroeder-kozey-and-wilderman397.myshopify.com/cart\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donation-box.png\" alt=\"donation box\" width=\"949\" height=\"721\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can see a demo of this <a href=\"http://schroeder-kozey-and-wilderman397.myshopify.com/cart\">here</a> (you&#8217;ll have to add a product in the cart first). </p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started! </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">1. Create a product for your donation</h2>\n<p>The first thing you need to do is create a product that will be your donation. This product will be a single-option, with a single variant worth $0.01. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donation-product.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donation-product.png\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;\" alt=\"donation product\" width=\"940\" height=\"754\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2591\" srcset=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donation-product.png 940w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donation-product-300x241.png 300w, http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donation-product-768x616.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px\" /></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">2. Add the donation product to a link list. </h2>\n<p>Create a link list called &#8220;Donation&#8221;. Add a product link, select &#8220;Product&#8221; under Links To, and then select the &#8220;Donation&#8221; product. It should look like this: </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donation-linklist.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/donation-linklist.png\" alt=\"donation linklist\" width=\"940\" height=\"323\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;\" /></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">3. Add a donation field to your cart page</h2>\n<p>This step is pretty theme-dependent. If you need a hand with placing and styling the textbox, please check with the designer of your theme or ask in the <a href=\"http://ecommerce.shopify.com/c/ecommerce-design\">design forums</a>.</p>\n<p>Grab the following code and place it inside your &#8220;cart.liquid&#8221; template. You may want to place is somewhere near your check out button. </p>\n<pre>\n<code>\n<h3 class=\"cart-donation\">\n   <p>Donation or Tip: </p>\n   <input type=\"text\" id=\"donate\" />\n</h3>\n</code>\n</pre>\n<h2 class=\"step\">4. Add the donation script to theme.liquid</h2>\n<p>Inside your Template Editor, create a new snippet called &#8220;donation-snippet&#8221;. Add the contents of <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Tetsuro/4403192/raw/85e4b6d9d22539c745d5f0e6c745e8226f2bc26f/gistfile1.txt\">this gist</a> inside it. </p>\n<p>Place the following code right before the &lt;/body&gt; tag in theme.liquid.</p>\n<pre>\n<code>\n{% include 'donation-snippet' %}\n</code>\n</pre>\n<h2 class=\"step\">(Optional) Hide the donation product&#8217;s price from the Checkout</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;ll notice that on the checkout page, it&#8217;ll show the quantity times $0.01 (shown below).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/checkout-price.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:9999/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/checkout-price.png\" alt=\"checkout price\" width=\"797\" height=\"557\" style=\"border:1px solid #ccc;\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to hide this, you can add a bit off CSS in your &#8220;checkout.css.liquid&#8221; file to hide the price. </p>\n<pre>\n<code>\nh3[title=\"Donation\"] + span{\n    display:none;\n}\n</code>\n</pre>\n<p>Make sure the value of &#8220;title&#8221; is the title of your product, which should be &#8220;Donation&#8221; if you&#8217;ve been following this tutorial :D.</p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">The End</h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s all!
