{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"January 2019: New Year, New Zealand Edition","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\n<p>I spent the entirety of January in New Zealand to hang out with Kylea and her family. This post is going to be a short one as I&#8217;m writing about my month in New Zealand in three separate posts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/new-zealand-trip-2019-part-1-chillin-up-north/\">Part 1: Chillin&#8217; Up North</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/new-zealand-trip-part-2-south-island-in-a-camper-van/\">Part 2: South Island in a Camper Van</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/new-zealand-trip-part-3-chillin-further-up-north/\">Part 3: Chillin&#8217; Further Up North</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m back home in Montreal now and getting back into my regular routine. I can&#8217;t believe how fast January went! Seems like just yesterday when I flew out for New Zealand on New Year&#8217;s Eve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I miss the beach life in New Zealand, it feels good to be back here in Montreal. I can&#8217;t wait to see my friends again and to get back to training jiu jitsu!</p>\n\t\t","wordpress_id":7215},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"january-2019-new-year-new-zealand-edition","wordpressId":7215,"newerPostSlug":"new-zealand-trip-part-2-south-island-in-a-camper-van","olderPostSlug":"new-zealand-trip-2019-part-1-chillin-up-north"}}
