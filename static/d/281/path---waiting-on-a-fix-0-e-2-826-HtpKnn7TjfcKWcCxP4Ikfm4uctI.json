{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Waiting on a fix","content":"<p>There is going to be yet another delay for the Shopify Tutorial from Scratch series, due to an ongoing bug with the list-collections.liquid template which I want to cover in Part 10. </p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s wrong?</h3>\n<p>The issue right now is that the template that is used for the collections listing page, aka. list-collections.liquid, does not load properly. When you go to your-shop.myshopify.com/collections, it&#8217;s supposed to load the contents of list-collections.liquid; but currently it does not. </p>\n<p>The only way to have content appear on /collections is by creating a snippet, and then checking for the template handle in theme.liquid as follows: </p>\n<pre>\n<code markup=\"span\">\n{% if template == 'list-collections' %}\n  {% include 'collection-listing' %}\n{% else %}\n  {{ content_for_layout }}\n{% endif %}\n</code>\n</pre>\n<p>This works but we shouldn&#8217;t have to do this. I want to make sure my tutorial doesn&#8217;t include any unnecessary workarounds. </p>\n<p>The awesome devs at Shopify are aware of the issue and are working on a fix. I really want to publish Part 10: list-collections.liquid tutorial before I move on to customer accounts because it just makes sense from an order point of view. </p>\n<p>Apologies again for the postponing üôÅ</p>\n<p>tetchi </p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"handle":"waiting-on-a-fix"}}
