{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Vectortuts Peer Review","content":"<p>Today I was browsing through Vectortuts and came across <a title=\"Vectortuts Community Peer Review\" href=\"http://vector.tutsplus.com/articles/theory/community-peer-review/\" target=\"_blank\">this</a> article. &#8220;What a great idea!&#8221; I thought, and I decided to man up and submit the &#8216;spiderdog&#8217; vector illustration that I made for peer review. I was a little hesitant at first because I thought maybe they&#8217;d tear it apart, but hey, how else are you going to learn right? I just hope it&#8217;s not too late for the awesome folks at Vectortuts to look over it.</p>\n<p>The spider-dog thing all started from a skateboard that we made at work (at Shopify we have design challenges, and this one was to make a cool skateboard deck). I&#8217;m not sure how it all started but I thought having a dog with multiple eyes was a cool eye-dea (SEE WHAT I DID THERE). Also, Burger King is awesome.</p>\n<p class=\"center\"><a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/skateboard-e1321582788690.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1847\" title=\"skateboard\" src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/skateboard-e1321582788690.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"373\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/skateboard-e1321582788690.jpg 373w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/skateboard-e1321582788690-224x300.jpg 224w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">The skateboard deck&#8230; I&#8217;m going to colour it sometime soon.</div>\n<p>After I was done with the skateboard, I was pretty happy with the result so I decided to take a picture and vectorize it. It was a good exercise for getting more familiar with the pen tool. It was also nice because I learned more how to use the Pathfinder tools.<!--more-->\n</p>\n<p class=\"center\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1852\" title=\"vectorizing\" src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/vectorizing-e1321583206419.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"418\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/vectorizing-e1321583206419.png 418w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/vectorizing-e1321583206419-150x150.png 150w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/vectorizing-e1321583206419-300x300.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px\" /></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Vectorizing the spider-dog</div>\n<p>I decided to vectorize only the head of the spider-dog because I thought it made a cool little &#8217;emblem&#8217;. Besides, the body could use a bit more work/refining.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really cool that Vectortuts is doing peer reviews, I&#8217;m really looking forward to reading their feedback!
