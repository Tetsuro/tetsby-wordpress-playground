As such, if you&#8217;re setting up a counter like in the example below, you must apply a math filter on it after to convert it back into a float/integer. </p>\n<pre>\n<code markup=\"none\">\n{% assign num = 0 %}\n\n<!-- num is still a number at this point -->\n{% for product in product.collections %}\n   {% if product.tags contains \"special\" %}\n       {% capture temp %}{{ num | plus: 1 }}{% endcapture %} \n   {% endif %}\n   <!-- at this point, temp becomes a string -->\n{% assign num = temp %}\n{% endfor %}\n\n<!-- Apply a math filter to num to convert it back into a number so you can use numerical operators on it -->\n{% assign num = num | plus: 0 %}\n\n{% if num > 5 %}\nYou have more than 5 special products, hooray!\n{% endif %}\n</code>\n</pre>\n<p>Thanks as usual to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolineschnapp\">Caro</a> for showing me the ways!</p>\n<p>THE END</p>\n","wordpress_id":2658},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Hi, this is perfect ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Any chance of storing this variable globally and show it on all other pages and not just this one?</p>\n"}},{"node":{"content":"<p>Holy crap!
