We had a lot of time to kill before checking in at our AirBnB, so we decided to chuck our bags in the train station&#x2019;s coin lockers and go explore the city.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>Holy frig, are Shinkansen bullet trains ever fast. Ours went up to about 300 km/h &#x2013; how crazy is that?! Maybe someday we&#x2019;ll get some of these badboys in Canada. Imagine going from Ottawa to Toronto in less than two hours!</p>\n<h3>Peace Memorial Park</h3>\n<p>Our first stop in Hiroshima was the Peace Memorial, a very serene park with many beautiful statues.</p>\n<p>One of the sights we checked out was the Genbaku Dome. The atomic bomb exploded 150m almost directly above it, and it&#x2019;s the only remaining building from the explosion. After the war there were several movements to get rid of the building as it reminded the locals of the horrible aftermath of the bomb. However, it was decided that the building be kept as a symbol of peace, and in 1996 it was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\n<p>There was a choir singing in the park when we were there. Their singing was beautiful and pulled at our heartstrings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSCF0847.jpg\" alt=\"Choir with genbaku dome in the background.\"></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Choir at the park, with Genbaku Dome in the background.</div>\n<h3>Peace Memorial Museum</h3>\n<p>After walking around the park for a bit we went to the Peace Memorial Museum. It consisted of artifacts from the bomb, such as clothes, accessories, and pieces of buildings.</p>\n<p>There were many horrific stories of the victims, but what stuck with me the most were the &#x201C;shadows&#x201D; that were etched into buildings after the bombing. These shadows are actually remnants of people who have been burned into the walls and roads. The fact that the spot on the concrete used to be a human being really freaked me out.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 77.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image \" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Hiroshima Shadow - from worldwar2database.com\" title src=\"/static/d67e0c828bf90ebd3d43fd7d78decf4f/a111b/wwii1439.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/d67e0c828bf90ebd3d43fd7d78decf4f/aca85/wwii1439.jpg 163w,\n/static/d67e0c828bf90ebd3d43fd7d78decf4f/0954f/wwii1439.jpg 325w,\n/static/d67e0c828bf90ebd3d43fd7d78decf4f/a111b/wwii1439.jpg 650w,\n/static/d67e0c828bf90ebd3d43fd7d78decf4f/ce471/wwii1439.jpg 975w,\n/static/d67e0c828bf90ebd3d43fd7d78decf4f/bee4e/wwii1439.jpg 1300w,\n/static/d67e0c828bf90ebd3d43fd7d78decf4f/45751/wwii1439.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\">\n  </span></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Photo credit: <a href=\"http://worldwar2database.com/\">worldwar2database.com</a></div>\n<p>Going to memorials and museums like these really makes me feel really grateful for my life, and reminds me of how fortunate I am.</p>\n<h3>Fun times at the AirBnB</h3>\n<p>The weirdest thing happened when we we arrived at the AirBnb.

We charged our electronics for a bit and then went back to the city to check out the nightlife.</p>\n<h3>Koba Rock Bar</h3>\n<p>We went to several bars in Hiroshima, but the coolest one was <a href=\"http://gethiroshima.com/nightlife/koba\">Koba</a>. It was a rock-themed bar and had a huge projection of old-school music videos playing on the wall.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSCF0866.jpg\" alt=\"DSCF0866\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4383\" srcset=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSCF0866.jpg 1280w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSCF0866-300x200.jpg 300w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSCF0866-768x512.jpg 768w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/DSCF0866-1024x682.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></p>\n<h3>Miyajima</h3>\n<p>On our second day we went out to Miyajima, aka the Island of Shrines.
