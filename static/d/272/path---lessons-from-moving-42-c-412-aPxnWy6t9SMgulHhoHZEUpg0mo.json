In this post I share some things I&#x2019;ve learned after moving to a new city for the first time.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>I own too much shit</h2>\n<p>Before the move to Montreal I got rid of as many possessions as possible. I sold anything that was collecting dust, including my XBOX 360, one of my unused bass guitars, air conditioner, etc. I also donated four garbage bags full of old clothes.</p>\n<p>Even with all of this effort, I was shocked at how much stuff I had to load into the U-Haul on moving day. I just <em>barely</em> fit everything into the truck, and I was pretty disappointed about this.</p>\n<p>Ever since, I&#x2019;ve been more conscious about buying <em>anything</em> that would take up space in my apartment. When I want to buy something, I ask myself the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much physical space will it take up?</li>\n<li>How easy is it to pack for future moves?</li>\n<li>Will it replace something that I already have? </li>\n<li>Will I still want to buy this thing after a week? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Asking myself these questions on a constant basis should hopefully prevent me from hoarding unnecessary junk. Having less things will make future moves so much easier.</p>\n<h2>I need to do a better job tracking my spendings</h2>\n<p>Moving to a new city got me thinking about how much I pay for rent, utilities, and other necessities; and that triggered me into thinking about how much money I spend on non-essential items.</p>\n<p>I started using an app called <a href=\"http://wally.me/\">Wally</a>, and it&#x2019;s <em>fantastic</em>. It&#x2019;s really simple; you enter in your monthly income, and every time you spend money you just punch in an amount and a category. The app then gives you an idea of what you&#x2019;re spending on and how much money you have left for the month.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n</p><div class=\" gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%\" data-reactroot><div style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:180%\"></div><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" alt style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition-delay:500ms\"><picture><img sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" srcset=\"/static/f3c2491e40a809021c17d235ad85fd6a/19bd1/iphone-base.png 163w,\n/static/f3c2491e40a809021c17d235ad85fd6a/d3bcb/iphone-base.png 325w,\n/static/f3c2491e40a809021c17d235ad85fd6a/6103d/iphone-base.png 340w\" src=\"/static/f3c2491e40a809021c17d235ad85fd6a/6103d/iphone-base.png\" alt style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"></picture><noscript><picture><img sizes=\"(max-width: 340px) 100vw, 340px\" srcset=\"/static/f3c2491e40a809021c17d235ad85fd6a/19bd1/iphone-base.png 163w,\n/static/f3c2491e40a809021c17d235ad85fd6a/d3bcb/iphone-base.png 325w,\n/static/f3c2491e40a809021c17d235ad85fd6a/6103d/iphone-base.png 340w\" src=\"/static/f3c2491e40a809021c17d235ad85fd6a/6103d/iphone-base.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></div>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are more automated solutions such as <a href=\"https://www.mint.com/canada\">Mint</a>, but I actually prefer Wally&#x2019;s manual approach. Manual input makes me think more about every dollar I spend, and it&#x2019;s nice to see how much money I have left in the month. It almost gamifies the process and encourages me to save more.</p>\n<h2>Writing tasks down helps me destress</h2>\n<p>While planning the move, I often stressed myself out thinking about all of the stuff I needed to do. Switching my insurance, transferring my driver&#x2019;s license and health card&#x2026; and so on. I&#x2019;d toss and turn in bed worrying that I&#x2019;d forgotten or overlooked something important.</p>\n<p>To remedy this, I started writing down tasks in my handy dandy notebook. Writing tasks down helped me better retain them in my head. Even if there wasn&#x2019;t anything I could do about an upcoming task at a given point in time, I took comfort in knowing that I&#x2019;d be reminded of it by my notebook when certain prerequisites were met.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n</p><div class=\" gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%\" data-reactroot><div style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:75.01875468867217%\"></div><img src=\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\" alt style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition-delay:500ms\"><picture><img sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" srcset=\"/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/aca85/IMG_7192.jpg 163w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/0954f/IMG_7192.jpg 325w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/a111b/IMG_7192.jpg 650w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/ce471/IMG_7192.jpg 975w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/bee4e/IMG_7192.jpg 1300w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/5bbf3/IMG_7192.jpg 1333w\" src=\"/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/a111b/IMG_7192.jpg\" alt style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"></picture><noscript><picture><img sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" srcset=\"/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/aca85/IMG_7192.jpg 163w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/0954f/IMG_7192.jpg 325w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/a111b/IMG_7192.jpg 650w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/ce471/IMG_7192.jpg 975w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/bee4e/IMG_7192.jpg 1300w,\n/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/5bbf3/IMG_7192.jpg 1333w\" src=\"/static/b2138f0b5cc9d04b1231a8672b98dea9/a111b/IMG_7192.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></div>\n<p></p>\n<p>I tried using one of many to-do apps for this, but I much prefer notebooks. This might sounds odd, but the feeling of <em>physically</em> crossing something off a list is insanely satisfying to me. Tapping a checkbox just doesn&#x2019;t do it.</p>\n<h2>Hobbies are dope and I need more of them in my life</h2>\n<p>More than ever I feel a deep appreciation for activities outside of work. This is probably because I&#x2019;m looking for ways to meet new people.</p>\n<p>For example, I love playing soccer. I played in various leagues with my friends and coworkers back in Ottawa, and was jonesin&#x2019; to find new people to play with. A few Saturdays ago a couple of coworkers and I biked down to Parc Jeanne Mance to play pick-up soccer with a bunch of random dudes. After the game we introduced ourselves to some of the other players, and we&#x2019;re now  part of a WhatsApp group of 50+ dudes that get together at the park to play soccer.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, I reached out to a guy on Kijiji looking for a jazz bassist for jazz jams. I&#x2019;ve been working on my upright bass chops for a while now and have been looking for jazz musicians to jam with. I&#x2019;ve since been to several jazz jams at La Brassette and was able to meet some really cool musicians. It&#x2019;s a great opportunity to learn what I need to work on too; for example, I learned that my bass soloing skills still need a lot of work.</p>\n<p>Moving to a new city has also been a great opportunity to discover new hobbies. As it turns out there&#x2019;s a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym right across from my place, so I&#x2019;ve been training there for a few weeks now. I made friends with some people who were also just getting started, and we&#x2019;re going to be getting together at the gym weekly to train. I hope to get to a level where I won&#x2019;t always get my ass handed to me during sparring drills.</p>\n<h2>After Montreal, I&#x2019;d love to move to a new country</h2>\n<p>I love everything about Montreal so far. But let&#x2019;s face it, it&#x2019;s not exactly that far from my hometown Ottawa. I still have this itch to live somewhere totally different.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m happy that I moved away from Ottawa, but my move is pretty bush league compared to my friends and coworkers who have moved halfway across the world. I don&#x2019;t really know where I&#x2019;d want to live after Montreal. Go back to my roots, in Japan? New Zealand seems pretty cool. France seems pretty rad, too. For now I&#x2019;m going to enjoy the crap out of Montreal.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for reading! If you&#x2019;re in Montreal and want to meet up for a drink, give me a shout &#x1F37B;\t\t</p>\n</body></html>","wordpress_id":5115},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Ohhh I checked out YNAB too, actually!
