{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Jammin&#8217;","content":"<p>\t\t\t\tThis past week was pretty music-filled. On Sunday I went to <a href=\"http://www.therainbow.ca/\">The Rainbow</a> to attend an open blues jam, hosted by local band <a href=\"http://www.wickedgrin.ca/\">Wicked Grin</a>. </p>\n<p>I was super comfortable playing at the blues jam as it was mostly 12-bar blues. I did some pretty good walking on the bass and really felt like I &#8220;clicked&#8221; with the drummer. It was also my first time playing my fretless on stage, so that was cool too. Big thanks to Wicked Grin for letting me jam with them! </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wicked-grin.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wicked-grin.jpg\" alt=\"Wicked Grin at the Rainbow\" title=\"Wicked Grin at the Rainbow\" width=\"800\" height=\"598\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2411\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wicked-grin.jpg 800w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wicked-grin-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wicked-grin-768x574.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Wicked Grin bluesin&#8217; it up</div>\n<p>Today I went to jam at the <a href=\"http://www.reneeyoxon.com/2012/04/29/saturday-afternoon-jazz-jam-at-pressed/\">Saturday Afternoon Jazz Jam</a> that I had mentioned in the previous post. I was much more nervous for this as I&#8217;ve never been to a jazz jam before. The way it works is you decide on a standard from a book such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Real-Book-Sixth-Edition/dp/0634060384\">The Real Book</a>, and just play the tune with the band. This of course is much more challenging than playing 12-bar blues as you need to compose &#038; play a song on-the-fly. </p>\n<p>Luckily I was pretty familiar with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q7J4PgrRsY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first jazz standard</a> that we jammed to, so that went pretty smoothly (although I really need to work on my rhythmic embellishments). The second one was a little flakey as I&#8217;d never seen it before and it was much more high-tempo. However as the song went on, I started to walk fairly comfortably. </p>\n<p>I was blown away by the guys that organized the jazz jams &#8211; they were just incredible talented and made it all look so easy! One of the organizers <a href=\"http://www.craigpedersen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Craig Pederson</a>&#8216;s bass-playing really blew my mind. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe Pressed Jazz Jam\" title=\"Cafe Pressed Jazz Jam\" width=\"800\" height=\"598\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2412\" srcset=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg 800w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pressed-jazz-jam-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/pressed-jazz-jam-768x574.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Amazingly talented jazz cats</div>\n<p>Both jams were awesome and the guys who organized them were really chill and friendly.
