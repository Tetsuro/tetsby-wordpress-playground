{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Jammin&#8217;","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>This past week was pretty music-filled. On Sunday I went to <a href=\"http://www.therainbow.ca/\">The Rainbow</a> to attend an open blues jam, hosted by local band <a href=\"http://www.wickedgrin.ca/\">Wicked Grin</a>. </p>\n<p>I was super comfortable playing at the blues jam as it was mostly 12-bar blues. I did some pretty good walking on the bass and really felt like I &#x201C;clicked&#x201D; with the drummer. It was also my first time playing my fretless on stage, so that was cool too. Big thanks to Wicked Grin for letting me jam with them! </p>\n<p><a href=\"/static/c45869dcdcd226bd1e961c097dcaa491/a296c/wicked-grin.jpg\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image alignnone size-full wp-image-2411\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Wicked Grin at the Rainbow\" title=\"Wicked Grin at the Rainbow\" src=\"/static/c45869dcdcd226bd1e961c097dcaa491/a111b/wicked-grin.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/c45869dcdcd226bd1e961c097dcaa491/aca85/wicked-grin.jpg 163w,\n/static/c45869dcdcd226bd1e961c097dcaa491/0954f/wicked-grin.jpg 325w,\n/static/c45869dcdcd226bd1e961c097dcaa491/a111b/wicked-grin.jpg 650w,\n/static/c45869dcdcd226bd1e961c097dcaa491/a296c/wicked-grin.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\">\n  </span></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Wicked Grin bluesin&#x2019; it up</div>\n<p>Today I went to jam at the <a href=\"http://www.reneeyoxon.com/2012/04/29/saturday-afternoon-jazz-jam-at-pressed/\">Saturday Afternoon Jazz Jam</a> that I had mentioned in the previous post. I was much more nervous for this as I&#x2019;ve never been to a jazz jam before. The way it works is you decide on a standard from a book such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Real-Book-Sixth-Edition/dp/0634060384\">The Real Book</a>, and just play the tune with the band. This of course is much more challenging than playing 12-bar blues as you need to compose &amp; play a song on-the-fly. </p>\n<p>Luckily I was pretty familiar with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Q7J4PgrRsY\" target=\"_blank\">first jazz standard</a> that we jammed to, so that went pretty smoothly (although I really need to work on my rhythmic embellishments). The second one was a little flakey as I&#x2019;d never seen it before and it was much more high-tempo. However as the song went on, I started to walk fairly comfortably. </p>\n<p>I was blown away by the guys that organized the jazz jams &#x2013; they were just incredible talented and made it all look so easy! One of the organizers <a href=\"http://www.craigpedersen.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Craig Pederson</a>&#x2018;s bass-playing really blew my mind. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/static/f726893d322db23d637d191f86465db4/a296c/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 74.75%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image alignnone size-full wp-image-2412\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Cafe Pressed Jazz Jam\" title=\"Cafe Pressed Jazz Jam\" src=\"/static/f726893d322db23d637d191f86465db4/a111b/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/f726893d322db23d637d191f86465db4/aca85/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg 163w,\n/static/f726893d322db23d637d191f86465db4/0954f/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg 325w,\n/static/f726893d322db23d637d191f86465db4/a111b/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg 650w,\n/static/f726893d322db23d637d191f86465db4/a296c/pressed-jazz-jam.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\">\n  </span></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Amazingly talented jazz cats</div>\n<p>Both jams were awesome and the guys who organized them were really chill and friendly.
