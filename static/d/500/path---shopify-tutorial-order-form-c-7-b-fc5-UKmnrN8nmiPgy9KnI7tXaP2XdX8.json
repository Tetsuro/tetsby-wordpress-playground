{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Shopify Tutorial: How to Create an Order Form","content":"<p>In this tutorial we&#8217;re going to be creating an order form in your shop that customers can use to add several items to the cart at once. You can see a demo of this <a href=\"https://stroman-nolan491.myshopify.com/pages/order-form\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>Please note that you cannot select any options/variants through the order form. The order form in this tutorial is set to always add the first variant of a product. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stroman-nolan491.myshopify.com/pages/order-form\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/product-table.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"product table\" width=\"1001\" height=\"457\" /></a></p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">1. Create a new linklist</h2>\n<p>The first thing you want to do is create a linklist that holds the products that you want to sell through the order form. Go to the &#8220;Navigation&#8221; page of your admin, and create a new linklist called &#8220;Order Form&#8221;. Next, add links to the products that you want to have listed on the order form.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/order-form-link-list.png\"><img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/order-form-link-list.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"order form link list\" width=\"943\" height=\"410\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2277\" /></a></p>\n<div class=\"sub\">The products that you enter in this linklist will be shown in the table that we&#8217;re going to create in the next step.</div>\n<h2 class=\"step\">2. Create an alternate &#8220;page&#8221; template</h2>\n<p>In your Template Editor, click &#8220;add a new template&#8221; under the Templates section. Select &#8220;page&#8221;, and call it &#8220;order-form&#8221;.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/template-editor.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/template-editor.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"template editor\" width=\"947\" height=\"784\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2282\" srcset=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/template-editor.png 947w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/template-editor-300x248.png 300w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/template-editor-768x636.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 947px) 100vw, 947px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Copy the code from this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Tetsuro/2932738/raw/7c0c5aea3cd59b35194f61e2c6c0b1c7f852f9fb/page.order-form.liquid\">gist</a> and paste it in page.order-form.liquid. Hit save. It&#8217;s pretty bare-bones, and there&#8217;s a bit of inline CSS so you&#8217;ll have to pretty it up a bit.</p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">3. Create a new page for your order form</h2>\n<p>Go to Blogs &#038; Pages, and create a new Page. You can title it whatever you wish. The important part here is to tell it to use the freshly-created page.order-form.liquid template. You do this by selecting it under the &#8220;Templates&#8221; dropdown, shown below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/order-page.png\"><img src=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/order-page.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"order page\" width=\"931\" height=\"644\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2289\" srcset=\"http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/order-page.png 931w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/order-page-300x208.png 300w, http://localhost:8888/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/order-page-768x531.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px\" /></a></p>\n<h2 class=\"step\">4. Download and add the Javascript</h2>\n<p>In your Template Editor, create a new snippet called &#8216;order-form-script&#8217;. Copy <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/Tetsuro/2932935/raw/568ccb0574f46eb450e298ab2ccb800e673d8fa2/jquery.order-form.js.liquid\">this script</a>, paste it in this new snippet, and hit Save. This script queues up every product from the Order Table link list, and adds them to the cart one-by-one with the power of AJAX.</p>\n<p>Finally, in &#8220;theme.liquid&#8221;, please place the code below right before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.</p>\n<pre>\n<code>\n{% include 'order-form-script' %}\n</code>\n</pre>\n<h2 class=\"step\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s all! Have fun ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 05/01/2013</strong> Fixed some stuff in the script.

I have created 3 sets of order forms by repeating the steps. After the 1st set was created and tested, everything was working nice as expected.

Could I get some help to identify the variable name which is responsible for carrying the qty to the cart.
