{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Move Your Mountain!","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>On March 5th, Move Your Mountain played its first show at Zaphod Beeblebrox. Move Your Mountain is a power-pop trio that Kevin, Chris and I started in August 2010. We&#x2019;ve been getting together once a week since September to jam, and March 5th was the night we finally unleashed our tunes. It was pretty intense practicing on weekly basis with school &amp; work, but I&#x2019;m really happy we powered through and continued to jam.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 66.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image alignnone size-medium wp-image-1348\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"pic\" title=\"pic\" src=\"/static/cfdb48d1c804e86fcddc9e3567ca2fd6/a111b/pic.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/cfdb48d1c804e86fcddc9e3567ca2fd6/aca85/pic.jpg 163w,\n/static/cfdb48d1c804e86fcddc9e3567ca2fd6/0954f/pic.jpg 325w,\n/static/cfdb48d1c804e86fcddc9e3567ca2fd6/a111b/pic.jpg 650w,\n/static/cfdb48d1c804e86fcddc9e3567ca2fd6/cad07/pic.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\">\n  </span>\n</p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Kev (guitar,vocals), Chris (drums, backup vocals), me (bass, backup vocals) &#x2013; photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fung_pi/\" target=\"_blank\">Jesse Lung</a></div>\n<p>Needless to say it was a wicked-awesome night. <a href=\"http://www.bandmix.ca/graemeweeks/\">The Start</a>, a local cover band opened the night with some kickass covers of British hits. We played our set after The Start. I was nervous as hell at first since it was our first time playing our tunes in front of an audience, but the nervousness melted away after a song or two (I think I was melting too, I was so damn sweaty on stage&#x2026; sorry for the B.O., guys). The headliner band, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/brainhunterrockandroll\">Brainhunter</a> ended the night with some rockin&#x2019; tunes (BRAAAAAINS anyone?). </p>\n<p>What was cool was that the next morning, we were mentioned in Andrew Carver&#x2019;s blog on <a href=\"http://natcaprock.blogspot.com/2011/03/from-start-to-finish.html\">National Capital Rock</a>. He&#x2019;s also got some sweet pictures from the show on his <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7218210@N02/5501697480/in/photostream/\">Flickr</a>.<br>\n<!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2642-588x441.jpg\" alt title=\"IMG_2642\" width=\"588\" height=\"441\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1354\">\n</p>\n<div class=\"sub\">There were lotsa people!</div>\n<p>We&#x2019;re going on a brief hiatus as Chris will be going on vacation, but things will really pick up once he comes back. I&#x2019;m going to be graduated from university, and back at Shopify full-time (hopefully). We&#x2019;ll be getting together more often to jam and play more shows, and we plan on recording sometime in May/June. Once we have good recordings, we&#x2019;ll be launching our <a href=\"http://moveyourmountainmusic.com/\">website</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>BIG THANK YOU</strong> to everyone for coming to the show, my buddy <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fung_pi/\" target=\"_blank\">Jesshi</a> for the awesome pictures, <a href=\"http://natcaprock.blogspot.com/\">Andrew Carver</a> for mentioning us on NatCapRock, and Brainhunter &amp; The Start for the awesome night, hopefully the first of many more.</p>\n</body></html>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"move-your-mountain"}}
