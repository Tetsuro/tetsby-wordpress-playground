This is really strange for me because I was never that into reading before. On average, I&#8217;d read one or two books a year. For some reason I started to read like a fiend, and I want to share some of the books that I&#8217;ve read in the past month or two. </p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h2>Piercing</h2>\n<div class=\"clearfix\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px; padding-bottom:30px; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;\">\n<div class=\"left forty\">\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Piercing-Ryu-Murakami/dp/014303863X\"><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/piercing.jpg\" alt=\"piercing\" width=\"296\" height=\"475\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2721\" srcset=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/piercing.jpg 296w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/piercing-187x300.jpg 187w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 296px) 100vw, 296px\" /><br />\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right sixty\">\n<p>Piercing was super freakin&#8217; weird. The main character Mr. Kawashima has this strange urge to kill his own baby, so he sets out to kill a prostitute to alleviate this urge. Yep, pretty f*cked up, I know. </p>\n<p>The book had a really Dexter-y vibe to it; you know the main character is a psycho but you still like him. It&#8217;s super-suspenseful and one of those books where you want to keep reading to find out what happens. Overall it was pretty rad but the ending was kind of so-so.</p>\n<p><strong>Rating: 3/5</strong>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy</h2>\n<div class=\"clearfix\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px; padding-bottom:30px; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;\">\n<div class=\"left forty\">\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy-Douglas-Adams/dp/0345391802\"><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hitchhiker.jpg\" alt=\"hitchhiker\" width=\"482\" height=\"729\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2737\" srcset=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hitchhiker.jpg 482w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hitchhiker-198x300.jpg 198w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 482px) 100vw, 482px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right sixty\">\n<p>Hitcher&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy is the funniest book I&#8217;ve ever read. It&#8217;s the first book that&#8217;s actually made me laugh out loud. I had to be careful reading this on the bus because it&#8217;d make me giggle like an idiot. The type of humour is so dry and quirky, something that&#8217;s new for me. It&#8217;s filled with gems like this:</p>\n<p><em>‚ÄúThe ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don&#8217;t.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t read Hitchhiker, I highly recommend picking it up. I can&#8217;t wait to read the rest of the series. </p>\n<p><strong>Rating: 5/5</strong>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Dr. Futurity</h2>\n<div class=\"clearfix\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px; padding-bottom:30px; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;\">\n<div class=\"left forty\">\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Dr-Futurity-Philip-K-Dick/dp/0425071065\"><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/dr-futurity.jpg\" alt=\"dr futurity\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right sixty\">\n<p>Dr. Futurity is a scifi story about Dr. Parsons, who mysteriously timeslips into a future society. Parsons learns the hard way that in this future society, healing and saving people&#8217;s lives is frowned upon and death is something that society looks forward to. He stirs a lot of shit when he instinctively saves a girl&#8217;s life, and the police decide to exile him to another planet (sucks for him haha).</p>\n<p>I feel like I would have enjoyed this more if I read it 40 years ago. I&#8217;ve seen a bunch of movies about time travel so the plot in Dr. Futurity was a bit predictable. Pretty cool read nonetheless. </p>\n<p><strong>Rating: 3/5</strong>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Scar Tissue</h2>\n<div class=\"clearfix\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px; padding-bottom:30px; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;\">\n<div class=\"left forty\">\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Scar-Tissue-Anthony-Kiedis/dp/1401301010\"><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/scar-tissue.jpg\" alt=\"scar tissue\" width=\"322\" height=\"500\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2742\" srcset=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/scar-tissue.jpg 322w, https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/scar-tissue-193x300.jpg 193w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right sixty\">\n<p>The Chili Peppers will always have a special place in my heart because I grew up listening to them throughout elementary and high school. I remember my dad bought me and my brother a copy of By the Way in the summer of 2002, and we would jam out to it in the car all the time. Also, Flea&#8217;s basslines are what made me want to pick up the bass. </p>\n<p>It was really cool to read about the ups and downs of Anthony Kiedis&#8217; life, including drug addictions/relapses, relationships, conflicts with bandmates, etc. My favourite parts in the book were when he explained the meaning behind the lyrics to RHCP songs. For example, I had no idea <em>Under the Bridge</em> was about the bond between him and LA, and shooting speedballs under a bridge. </p>\n<p><strong>Rating: 4/5</strong>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>How to Stop Worrying and Start Living</h2>\n<div class=\"clearfix\" style=\"margin-bottom:30px; padding-bottom:30px; border-bottom:1px solid #ccc;\">\n<div class=\"left forty\">\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/How-Stop-Worrying-Start-Living/dp/0671733354\"><img src=\"https://tetsuro.github.io/tetsby-wordpress-playground/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/how-to-stop-worrying.gif\" alt=\"how to stop worrying\" width=\"289\" height=\"475\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2744\" /></a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"right sixty\">\n<p>I picked this book up because I&#8217;m a big fan of self-improvement books. I enjoyed reading <a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671723650\">How to Win Friends and Influence People</a> a while back, so I decided to pick up another one of Carnegie&#8217;s books. </p>\n<p>Now I know you may think it&#8217;s silly to read a book about how to stop worrying but I think it&#8217;s harder than most people think. We *know* that worrying is something we should stop doing, but we still do it anyway. <em>How to Stop Worrying</em> does an excellent job explaining why worrying is a big waste of time and energy. It&#8217;s also jam-packed with examples of how real people got over their worries (the book was written in the 40s so the examples are a little dated, but they arre definitely still relevant). </p>\n<p><strong>Rating: 4.5/5</strong>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Next on my list:</p>\n<p>&#8211; The rest of the Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy series<br />\n&#8211; Brave New World by Aldous Huxley<br />\n&#8211; Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes<br />\n&#8211; Neil Young&#8217;s Waging Heavy Peace</p>\n<p>If you have any recommendations, please let me know üôÇ</p>\n<p>THE END\t\t</p>\n","wordpress_id":8095},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[{"node":{"content":"<p>Dude just made a goodreads account!
