{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Move Your Mountain!","content":"<html><head></head><body><p>\t\t\t\tOn March 5th, Move Your Mountain played its first show at Zaphod Beeblebrox. Move Your Mountain is a power-pop trio that Kevin, Chris and I started in August 2010. We&#x2019;ve been getting together once a week since September to jam, and March 5th was the night we finally unleashed our tunes. It was pretty intense practicing on weekly basis with school &amp; work, but I&#x2019;m really happy we powered through and continued to jam.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/pic-588x392.jpg\" alt title=\"pic\" width=\"588\" height=\"392\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1348\">\n</p>\n<div class=\"sub\">Kev (guitar,vocals), Chris (drums, backup vocals), me (bass, backup vocals) &#x2013; photo by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fung_pi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jesse Lung</a></div>\n<p>Needless to say it was a wicked-awesome night. <a href=\"http://www.bandmix.ca/graemeweeks/\">The Start</a>, a local cover band opened the night with some kickass covers of British hits. We played our set after The Start. I was nervous as hell at first since it was our first time playing our tunes in front of an audience, but the nervousness melted away after a song or two (I think I was melting too, I was so damn sweaty on stage&#x2026; sorry for the B.O., guys). The headliner band, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/brainhunterrockandroll\">Brainhunter</a> ended the night with some rockin&#x2019; tunes (BRAAAAAINS anyone?). </p>\n<p>What was cool was that the next morning, we were mentioned in Andrew Carver&#x2019;s blog on <a href=\"http://natcaprock.blogspot.com/2011/03/from-start-to-finish.html\">National Capital Rock</a>. He&#x2019;s also got some sweet pictures from the show on his <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7218210@N02/5501697480/in/photostream/\">Flickr</a>.<br>\n<!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n<img src=\"https://www.tetchi.ca/tetchi/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_2642-588x441.jpg\" alt title=\"IMG_2642\" width=\"588\" height=\"441\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1354\">\n</p>\n<div class=\"sub\">There were lotsa people!</div>\n<p>We&#x2019;re going on a brief hiatus as Chris will be going on vacation, but things will really pick up once he comes back. I&#x2019;m going to be graduated from university, and back at Shopify full-time (hopefully). We&#x2019;ll be getting together more often to jam and play more shows, and we plan on recording sometime in May/June. Once we have good recordings, we&#x2019;ll be launching our <a href=\"http://moveyourmountainmusic.com/\">website</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>BIG THANK YOU</strong> to everyone for coming to the show, my buddy <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/fung_pi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jesshi</a> for the awesome pictures, <a href=\"http://natcaprock.blogspot.com/\">Andrew Carver</a> for mentioning us on NatCapRock, and Brainhunter &amp; The Start for the awesome night, hopefully the first of many more.</p>\n</body></html>","wordpress_id":1347},"allWordpressWpComments":{"edges":[]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"move-your-mountain","wordpressId":1347,"newerPostSlug":"move-your-mountain-logo","olderPostSlug":"boomi"}}
